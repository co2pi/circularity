#Circularity Accounting Model

This repository contains the tools for training CO2 sequence models for the circularity accounting model project, which develops a CO2 estimator and a CO2 production-consumption chain predictor

The model architecture is based on front end image detectors and recognizers connected to production chain sequence models. Training of the network modules can be designed using the graph tool at:
