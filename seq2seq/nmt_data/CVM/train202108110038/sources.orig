He knew that, as one of the founders of the Canada First party, as Chairman of the Organising Committee of the Imperial Federation League in Canada, then President of it, and after its reorganisation, under the name of the British Empire League in Canada, still President, I had much private information, in connection with the struggle for Imperial Unity, that would be of interest to the public.
He was therefore continually urging me to put down my recollections in order that they should be preserved.
I put the matter off until the year 1899, when I was retired from the command of my regiment on reaching the age limit.
I then wrote my military recollections under the title _Soldiering in Canada_.
This was so well received by the Press and by the public that, being still urged to prepare my political reminiscences, I began some years ago to write them, and soon had them finished.
In the early part of 1908 Dr. Bain read the manuscript, and then asked me not to delay, as I had intended, but to publish at once.
Shortly before his death last spring, he again expressed this wish.
I have consulted several of my friends, and in view of their advice now publish this book.
I have not attempted to write a history of the Imperial Unity movement, but only my personal recollections of the work which I have been doing in connection with it for so many years.
I still feel, as I did when I was writing my military recollections, that I should follow the view laid down by the critic who said that reminiscences should be written just in the style in which a man would relate them to an old friend while smoking a pipe in front of a fire.
I have tried to write the following pages in that spirit, and if the personal pronoun appears too often, it will be because, being recollections of work done, it can hardly be avoided.
When Canada was conquered and the power of France disappeared from North America, Great Britain then possessed the thirteen States or Colonies, as well as the Provinces of Quebec and Nova Scotia.
The thirteen colonies had increased in population and wealth, and the British statesmen burdened with the heavy expenses of the French wars, which had been waged mainly for the protection of the American States, felt it only just that these Colonies should contribute something towards defraying the cost incurred in defending them.
This raised the whole question of taxation without representation, and for ten years the discussion was waged vigorously between the Mother Country and the Colonists.
A large number of the Colonists felt the justice of the claim of the Mother Country for some assistance, but foresaw the danger of violent and arbitrary action in enforcing taxation without the taxed having any voice in the matter.
These men, the Loyalists, were afterwards known by the name United Empire Loyalists, because they advocated and struggled for the organisation of a consolidated Empire banded together for the common interest.
Thomas Hutchinson, the last loyalist Governor of Massachusetts, and one of the ablest of the loyalist leaders, believed in the magnificent dream of a great Empire, to be realised by the process of natural and legal development, in full peace and amity with the Motherland, in short, by evolution.
Joseph Galloway, who shared with Thomas Hutchinson the supreme place among the American statesmen opposed to the Revolution, worked incessantly in the cause of a United Empire, and has been characterised as "The giant corypheus of the pamphleteers."
He was a member of the first continental Congress and introduced into that body, on the 28th September, 1774, his famous "Plan of a proposed union between Great Britain and the Colonies."
In introducing this plan Galloway made some most interesting remarks, which bear their lesson through all the years to the present day.
He said:   I am as much a friend of liberty as exists.
We want the aid and  assistance and protection of the arm of our Mother Country.
Protection  and allegiance are reciprocal duties.
Can we lay claim to the money  and protection of Great Britain upon any principles of honour and  conscience?
Can we wish to become aliens to the Mother State?
We must  come upon terms with Great Britain.
Is it not necessary that the trade  of the Empire should be regulated by some power or other?
Can the  Empire hold together without it?
Who shall regulate it?
Galloway's scheme was very nearly adopted.
In the final trial it was lost by a vote of only six colonies to five.
This rejection led Galloway to decline an election to the second Congress, and to appeal to the higher tribunal of public opinion.
The Loyalists followed this lead, and the struggle went on for seven years, between those who fought for separation and independence and those who fought for the unity of the Empire.
The Revolution succeeded through the mismanagement of the British forces by the general in command, followed by the intervention of three great European nations, who were able to secure temporary command of the sea.
The United Empire Loyalists were driven out of the old colonies, and many found new homes in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Canada; some also went to England and the West Indies, carrying with them the cherished ideas of maintaining their allegiance to their Sovereign, of preserving their heritage as British subjects, and still endeavouring to realise the dream of a United British Empire.
For this cause they had made great sacrifices, and, despoiled of all their possessions, had been driven into exile, in what was then a wilderness.
Men do not make such extraordinary sacrifices except under the influence of some overpowering sentiment, and in their case the moving sentiment was the Unity of the Empire.
The greater the hardships they encountered, the greater the privations and sufferings they endured for the cause, the dearer it grew to their hearts, for men value those things most that have been obtained at the highest cost.
In the war of 1812-'14 the intense spirit of loyalty in the old exiles and their sons caused the Canadian Provinces to be retained under the British flag, and when afterwards, in 1837, rebellion broke out, fomented by strangers and new settlers, the United Empire Loyalist element put it down with a promptitude and vigour that forms one of the brightest pages in our history.
In Nova Scotia the agitation for responsible government was headed by Joseph Howe, a son of one of the exiled Loyalists.
Suggestions of rebellion to him were impossible of consideration, and he held his province true to the Empire, and succeeded by peaceful and loyal measures in securing all he wanted.
Then Great Britain repealed her corn laws instead of amending them, and introduced free trade instead of rearranging and reducing her tariff.
She deprived Canada of a small advantage which her products up to that time enjoyed in the British markets, and which was rapidly assisting in the development of what was then a poor and weak colony.
This act was a severe blow to Canada, because it meant that Great Britain had embarked on the unwise and dangerous policy of treating foreign and even hostile countries as favourably as her own peoples and her own possessions.
This caused a great deal of dissatisfaction in some quarters, and in the year 1849 some hundreds of the leading business men in Montreal signed a manifesto advocating annexation to the United States.
This aroused strong opposition among the United Empire Loyalist element in Upper Canada; the feeling soon manifested itself in a way which proved that no pecuniary losses could shake the deep-seated loyalty of the Canadian people.
The annexation movement withered at once.
Seeing how severely the action of the Mother Country had borne upon Canada, Lord Elgin, then Governor-General of Canada, was instructed to endeavour to arrange for a reciprocity treaty with the United States, or in other words to ask a foreign country to give Canada trade advantages which would recompense her for what Great Britain had taken away from her.
The United States Government, either influenced by the blandishments of Lord Elgin, or by a politic desire of turning Canada's trade in their own direction, and making her dependent for her business and the prosperity of her people upon a treaty which the United States would have the power of terminating in twelve years, consented to make the treaty.
It was concluded in 1854, and for twelve years during a most critical period, when railways and railway systems were beginning to be established, the great bulk of the trade of Canada was diverted to the United States, the lines of transportation naturally developed mainly from north to south, and the foreign handling of our products was left very much to the United States.
The Crimean war broke out in 1854 and lasted till 1856, raising the price of farm produce two-fold, and adding largely to the prosperity of the Canadian people.
The large railway expenditure during the same period also aided to produce an era of inflation, while during the last five years of the existence of the treaty the Civil War in the United States created an extraordinary demand, at war prices, for almost everything the Canadian people had to sell.
The result was that, from reasons quite disconnected from the reciprocity treaty, during a great part of its existence the Canadian people enjoyed a most remarkable development and prosperity.
The United States Government, although the treaty is said to have been of more real value to them than to Canada, at the earliest possible moment gave the two years' notice to abrogate it, and they did so evidently in the hope that the financial distress and loss that its discontinuance would bring upon the people of Canada would create at once a demand for annexation.
In a sense they were right; talk in favour of annexation was soon heard from a few, but the old sentiment of loyalty to the Empire was too strong, and the people turned to the idea of the confederation of the Provinces and the opening up of trade with the West Indies and other countries.
The Confederation of Canada was the result, and the Dominion was established on the 1st of July, 1867.
My object in writing the following pages is to describe more particularly from my own recollection, and my own knowledge of the facts, the movement in favour of the Unity of the Empire which has been going on during the last forty years.
The ideas, sentiments, aspirations, and hopes of the people have since then been revolutionised.
At that time the North American Provinces were poor, sparsely settled, scattered communities, with no large towns, no wealthy classes, without a literature, with scarcely any manufactures, and with a population almost entirely composed of struggling farmers and the few traders depending upon them.
The population was less than 3,500,000.
The total exports and imports in 1868 were $131,027,532.
The small Provincial Governments found their duties confined to narrow local limits.
All the important questions were entirely in the hands of the Home Government.
The defence was paid for by them.
British troops occupied all the important points, and foreign affairs were left without question entirely in the hands of the British statesmen.
The Provinces had no power whatever in diplomacy, and were interested only in a few disputes with the United States in reference to boundary difficulties, which were generally settled without consultation with the Colonial Governments, and with very little thought for the interests or the future needs of the little British communities scattered about in North America.
The settlements were comparatively so recent that men called themselves either English, Irish, or Scotch, according to the nationality of their parents or grandparents.
The national societies, St. George's, St. Andrew's and St. Patrick's, may have helped to continue this feeling, so that in reference to the various Provinces there was not, and could not be, any national spirit.
Another cause that led to the absence of national spirit or self-confidence was that Great Britain not only held the power of peace and war in her own hands, but, as a consequence, took upon herself the responsibility for the defence of the Provinces.
British troops, as has been said, garrisoned all the important points, and all the expenses were borne by the Imperial Government.
Canada had no militia except upon paper, no arms, no uniforms, no military stores or equipment of any kind.
She depended solely upon the Mother Country; even the Post Office System was a branch of the English Post Office Service.
One can readily imagine the lack of local national spirit.
Of course the loyalty to the Mother Country and the Sovereign and the Empire was always strong, but it was not closely allied to the spirit of nationality as attached to the soil.
When the Crimean war broke out, the British troops were required for it, and Canada was called upon to raise a militia force for her own needs.
This she did.
Ten thousand men were organised, armed, uniformed, and equipped at her expense.
They were called the Active Militia, and were drilled ten days in each year.
The assumption of responsibility had an effect upon the country, and when the Trent difficulty arose the force was increased by the spontaneous action of the people to about thirty-eight thousand men.
Four years later the Fenian raids took place upon our frontier, and were repulsed, largely by the efforts of the Canadian Militia.
All this appealed to the imagination of our youth, and as confederation was proclaimed the following year the ground was fallow for sowing seeds of a national spirit.
The effect of confederation on the Canadians was very remarkable.
The small Provinces were all merged into a great Dominion.
The Provincial idea was gone.
Canada was now a country with immense resources and great possibilities.
The idea of expansion had seized upon the people, and at once steps were taken looking to the absorption of the Hudson's Bay Territory and union with British Columbia.
With this came visions of a great and powerful country stretching from ocean to ocean, and destined to be one of the dominant powers of the world.
Foster of Toronto, a barrister, afterwards a leading Queen's Counsel, was there at the same time, and through our friend, Henry J. Morgan, we were introduced to Charles Mair, of Lanark, Ontario, and Robert J. Haliburton, of Halifax, eldest son of the celebrated author of "Sam Slick."
We were five young men of about twenty-eight years of age, except Haliburton, who was four or five years older.
We very soon became warm friends, and spent most of our evenings together in Morgan's quarters.
We must have been congenial spirits, for our friendship has been close and firm all our lives.
Foster and Haliburton have passed away, but their work lives.
The seed they sowed has sprung at last,     And grows and blossoms through the land.
[1]  Those meetings were the origin of the "Canada First" party.
Nothing could show more clearly the hold that confederation had taken of the imagination of young Canadians than the fact that, night after night, five young men should give up their time and their thoughts to discussing the higher interests of their country, and it ended in our making a solemn pledge to each other that we would do all we could to advance the interests of our native land; that we would put our country first, before all personal, or political, or party considerations; that we would change our party affiliations as often as the true interests of Canada required it.
Some years afterwards we adopted, as I will explain, the name "Canada First," meaning that the true interest of Canada was to be first in our minds on every occasion.
Forty years have elapsed and I feel that every one of the five held true to the promise we then made to each other.
One point that we discussed constantly was the necessity, now that we had a great country, of encouraging in every possible way the growth of a strong national spirit.
Ontario knew little of Nova Scotia or New Brunswick and they knew little of us.
The name Canadian was at first bitterly objected to by the Nova Scotians, while the New Brunswickers were indifferent.
This was natural, for old Canada had been an almost unknown Province to the men who lived by the sea, and whose trade relations had been mainly with the United States, the West Indies, and foreign countries.
It was apparent that until there should grow, not only a feeling of unity, but also a national pride and devotion to Canada as a Dominion, no real progress could be made towards building up a strong and powerful community.
We therefore considered it to be our first duty to work in that direction and do everything possible to encourage national sentiment.
History had taught us that every nation that had become great, and had exercised an important influence upon the world, had invariably been noted for a strong patriotic spirit, and we believed in the sentiment of putting the country above all other considerations--the same feeling that existed in Rome      When none was for a party     When all were for the State.
This idea we were to preach in season and out of season whenever opportunity offered.
The next point that attracted our attention was the necessity of securing for the new Dominion the Hudson's Bay Territory and the adhesion of British Columbia.
At this time the Maritime Provinces were not keenly interested in either of these projects, while the province of Quebec was secretly opposed to the acquisition of the Territory, fearing that it would cost money to acquire and govern it, but principally because many of the French Canadians dreaded the growing strength in the Dominion of English speaking people, and the consequent relative diminution of their proportionate influence on the administration of affairs.
The Hudson's Bay Company were also dissatisfied at the prospect of the loss of the great monopoly they had enjoyed for nearly two hundred years.
They continued the policy they had early adopted, of doing all possible to create the belief that the territory was a barren, inhospitable, frozen region, unfit for habitation, and only suitable to form a great preserve for fur-bearing animals.
This general belief as to the uselessness of the country, and its remoteness and inaccessibility, which prevented any full information being gained as to its real capabilities, also had the effect of making many people doubtful as to its value and careless as to its acquisition.
As an illustration of the ignorance and false impressions of the value of the country, it is interesting to recall that when, in 1857, an agitation was set on foot looking to the absorption of the North-West Territories, very strong opposition came from a large portion of the Canadian Press.
Some wrote simply in the interests of the Hudson's Bay Company.
Some wrote what they really believed to be true.
Now that Manitoba No.
1 hard wheat has a fame all over the world, as the best and most valuable wheat that is grown, it is interesting to read the opinion of the Montreal Transcript in 1857 that the climate of the North-West "is altogether unfavourable to the growth of grain" and that the summer is so short as to make it difficult to "mature even a small potato or a cabbage."
The Government, under the far-seeing leadership of Sir John Macdonald, were negotiating in 1868 for the purchase of the Hudson's Bay Company's rights, and they sent Sir George Cartier and the Hon.
Macdougall to England to carry on the negotiations.
Mr. Macdougall was a man of great force of character, an able debater and a keen Canadian.
We knew he would do all that man could do to secure the territory for Canada, and as far as the arrangements in the old country were concerned he was successful.
In anticipation of the incorporation of the territory in the Dominion, and partly to assist the Red River Settlement by giving employment to the people, the Canadian Government sent up some officials and began building a road from Fort Garry, now Winnipeg, to the north-west angle of the Lake of the Woods.
This was in the autumn of 1868.
Mr. Macdougall appointed Charles Mair to the position of paymaster of this party, and at once we saw the opportunity of doing some good work towards helping on the acquisition of the territory.
We felt that the country was misunderstood, and it was arranged, through the Hon.
George Brown, the proprietor and editor of the Toronto _Globe_, who had for many years been strongly in favour of securing the North-West, that Mair was to write letters to the _Globe_ on every available opportunity, giving a true account of the capabilities of the territory as to the soil, products, climate, and suitability for settlement.
Mair soon formed a most favourable opinion, and became convinced that a populous agricultural community could be maintained, and that in time to come a large and productive addition would be made to the farming resources of Canada.
He pictured the country in glowing terms, and practically preached that a crusade of Ontario men should move out and open up and cultivate its magnificent prairies.
His letters attracted a great deal of attention, and were copied very extensively in the Press of Upper Canada and the Maritime Provinces.
They were filled with the Canadian national spirit, and had a great effect in awakening the minds of the people to the importance of the acquisition of the country.
Reports of his letters got back to Fort Garry, and caused much hostile feeling in the minds of the Hudson's Bay officials, and the French half-breeds and their clergy.
The feeling on one occasion almost led to actual violence.
He was then a young doctor only twenty-two years of age.
He at once engaged in the practice of his profession, as well as in the business of buying and selling furs, and trading with the Indians and inhabitants.
He was born at Amherstburg, and had grown up and been educated in the country where Brock and Tecumseh had performed their greatest exploit in defence of Canada.
He was a loyal and patriotic Canadian.
He had been persecuted by Hudson's Bay officials.
Once he was put in prison by them, but was soon taken out by a mob of the inhabitants.
Mair soon became attached to Schultz.
They were about the same age, and possessed in common a keen love for the land of their birth.
Mair told him of the work of our little party, and he expressed his sympathy and desire to assist.
In March, 1869, Schultz came down to Montreal on business, and when passing through Toronto brought me a letter of introduction from Mair, who had written to me once or twice before, speaking in the highest terms of Schultz, and predicting (truthfully) that in the future he would be the leading man in the North-West, and he advised that he should be enrolled in our little organisation.
Haliburton happened to be in Toronto at the time and I introduced Schultz to him and to W. A.
Foster, and we warmly welcomed him into our ranks.
He was the sixth member.
Soon afterwards we began quietly making recruits, considering very carefully each name as suggested.
Schultz went back to Fort Garry.
The negotiations for the acquisition of the Hudson's Bay Territory were brought to a successful termination, and it was arranged that it should be taken over on the 1st December, 1869.
Mr. Macdougall was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of the Territory, and with a small staff of officials he started for Fort Garry.
During this time Haliburton had been lecturing in Ontario and Quebec on the question of "interprovincial trade," showing that it should be strongly encouraged, and would be a most efficient means for creating a feeling of unity among the various provinces.
He also delivered a very able lecture on "The Men of the North," showing their power and influence on history, and pointing out that the Canadians would be the "Northmen of the New World," and in this way he endeavoured to arouse the pride of Canadians in their country, and to create a feeling of confidence in its future.
This was all in the line of our common desire to foster a national spirit, which formerly, in the Canadian sense, had not existed.
This officer had taken a prominent part in the affair of the Fenian Raid at Fort Erie three years before, with no advantage to the country and considerable discredit to himself.
His party began surveying the land where a hardy population of half-breeds had their farms and homes, and where they had been settled for generations.
Naturally great alarm and indignation were aroused.
The road that was being built from Winnipeg to the Lake of the Woods also added considerably to their anxiety.
The Hudson's Bay officials were mainly covertly hostile.
The French priests also viewed an irruption of strangers with strong aversion, and everything tended to incite an uprising against the establishment of the new Government.
When Lieut.-Governor Macdougall arrived at Pembina and crossed the boundary line, he was stopped by an armed force of French half breeds, and turned back out of the country.
He waited till the 1st December, when his commission was to have come into force, and then appointed Lieut.-Colonel Dennis as Lieutenant and Conservator of the Peace, and sent him to Fort Garry to endeavour to organise a sufficient force among the loyal population to put down the rebellion, and re-establish the Queen's authority.
When Lieut.-Colonel Dennis reached Fort Garry, he went straight to Dr. Schultz' house where Mair was staying at the time, and showed them his commission.
Schultz, who was an able man of great courage and strength of character, as well as sound judgment, said at once that the commission was all that was wanted, and that he would organise a force of the surveyors, Canadian roadmen, etc., who were principally Ontario men, and that they could easily seize the Fort that night by surprise, as there were only a few of the insurgents in it, and those not anticipating the slightest difficulty.
This was the wisest and best course, for had the Fort been seized, it would have dominated the settlement and established a rallying point for the loyal, who formed fifty per cent.
of the population.
Colonel Dennis would not agree to this.
On the contrary he advised Dr. Schultz to organise all the men he could at the Fort Garry Settlement, while he himself would go down to the Stone Fort, and raise the loyal Scotch half breeds of the lower Settlements.
This decision at once shut off all possibility of success.
Riel, the rebel leader, had ample opportunity not only to fill Fort Garry with French half breeds, but it enabled him to cut off and besiege Dr. Schultz and the Canadians who had gathered at his house for protection.
When matters had got to this point Colonel Dennis lost heart, abandoned his levies at the Stone Fort in the night, leaving an order for them to disperse and return to their homes.
He escaped to the United States by making a wide _détour_.
Schultz and his party had to surrender and were put into prison.
Mair, Dr. Lynch, and Thomas Scott were among these prisoners.
When the news of these doings came to Ontario there was a good deal of dissatisfaction, but the distance was so great, and the news so scanty, and so lacking in details, that the public generally were not at first much interested.
The Canada First group were of course keenly aroused by the imprisonment and dangerous position of Mair and Schultz, and at that time matters looked very serious to those of us who were so keenly anxious for the acquisition of the Hudson's Bay Territory.
Lieut.-Governor Macdougall had been driven out, his deputy had disappeared after his futile and ill-managed attempt to put down the insurrection, Mair and Schultz and the loyal men were in prison, Riel had established his government firmly, and had a large armed force and the possession of the most important stronghold in the country.
An unbroken wilderness of hundreds of miles separated the district from Canada, and made a military expedition a difficult and tedious operation.
These difficulties, however, we knew were not the most dangerous.
There were many influences working against the true interests of Canada, and it is hard for the present generation to appreciate the gravity of the situation.
In the first place the people of Ontario were indifferent, they did not at first seem to feel or understand the great importance of the question, and this indifference was the greatest source of anxiety to us in the councils of our party.
By this time Foster and I had gained a number of recruits.
Dr. Canniff, J. D. Edgar, Richard Grahame, Hugh Scott, Thomas Walmsley, George Kingsmill, Joseph E. McDougall, and George M. Rae had all joined the executive committee, and we had a number of other adherents ready and willing to assist.
Foster and I were constantly conferring and discussing the difficulties, and meetings of the committee were often called to decide upon the best action to adopt.
Governor Macdougall had returned humiliated and baffled, blaming the Hon.
Joseph Howe for having fed the dissatisfaction at Fort Garry.
This charge has not been supported by any evidence, and such evidence as there is conveys a very different impression.
Governor McTavish of the Hudson's Bay Company was believed to be in collusion with Riel, and willing to thwart the aims of Canada.
Mr. Macdougall states in his pamphlet of _Letters to Joseph Howe_, that in September 1868 every member of the Government, except Mr. Tilley and himself, was either indifferent or hostile to the acquisition of the Territories.
He also charges the French Catholic priests as being very hostile to Canada, and says that from the moment he was met with armed resistance, until his return to Canada, the policy of the Government was consistent in one direction, namely, to abandon the country.
Dr. George Bryce in his _Remarkable History of the Hudson's Bay Company_ points out the serious condition of affairs at this time.
The Company's Governor, McTavish, was ill, the government by the Company moribund, and the action of the Canadian authorities in sending up an irritating expedition of surveyors and roadmakers was most impolitic.
The influence of mercantile interests in St. Paul was also keenly against Canada, and a number of settlers from the United States helped to foment trouble and encourage a change of allegiance.
Dr. Bryce states that there was a large sum of money "available in St. Paul for the purpose of securing a hold by the Americans on the fertile plains of Rupert's Land."
Dr. Bryce sums up the dangers as follows: "Can a more terrible combination be imagined than this?
A decrepit Government with the executive officer sick; a rebellious and chronically dissatisfied Metis element; a government at Ottawa far removed by distance, committing with unvarying regularity blunder after blunder; a greedy and foreign cabal planning to seize the country; and a secret Jesuitical plot to keep the Governor from action and to incite the fiery Metis to revolt."
The Canada First organisation was at this time a strictly secret one, its strength, its aims, even its existence being unknown outside of the ranks of the members.
The committee were fully aware of all these difficulties, and felt that the people generally were not impressed with the importance of the issues and were ignorant of the facts.
The idea had been quietly circulated through the Government organs that the troubles had been caused mainly through the indiscreet and aggressive spirit shown by the Canadians at Fort Garry, and much aggravated through the ill-advised and hasty conduct of Lieut.-Governor Macdougall.
The result was that there was little or no sympathy with any of those who had been cast into prison, except among the ranks of the little Canada First group, who understood the question better, and had been directly affected through the imprisonment of two of their leading members.
The news came down in the early spring of 1870 that Schultz and Mair had escaped, and soon afterwards came the information that Thomas Scott, a loyal Ontario man, an Orangeman, had been cruelly put to death by the Rebel Government.
Up to this time it had been found difficult to excite any interest in Ontario in the fact that a number of Canadians had been thrown into prison.
Foster and I, who had been consulting almost daily, were much depressed at the apathy of the public, but when we heard that Schultz and Mair, as well as Dr. Lynch, were all on the way to Ontario, and that Scott had been murdered, it was seen at once that there was an opportunity, by giving a public reception to the loyal refugees, to draw attention to the matter, and by denouncing the murder of Scott, to arouse the indignation of the people, and foment a public opinion that would force the Government to send up an armed expedition to restore order.
George Kingsmill, the editor of the Toronto _Daily Telegraph_, at that time was one of our committee, and on Foster's suggestion the paper was printed in mourning with "turned rules" as a mark of respect to the memory of the murdered Scott, and Foster, who had already contributed able articles to the _Westminster Review_ in April and October 1865, began a series of articles which were published by Kingsmill as editorials, which at once attracted attention.
It was like putting a match to tinder.
Foster was accustomed to discuss these articles with me, and to read them to me in manuscript, and I was delighted with the vigour and intense national spirit which breathed in them all.
He met the arguments of the official Press with vehement appeals to the patriotism of his fellow countrymen.
The Government organs were endeavouring to quiet public opinion, and suggestions were freely made that the loyal Canadians who had taken up arms on behalf of the Queen's authority in obedience to Governor Macdougall's proclamation had been indiscreet, and had brought upon themselves the imprisonment and hardships they had suffered.
Mair and Schultz had escaped from prison about the same time.
Schultz went to the Lower Red River which was settled by loyal English-speaking half breeds, and Mair to Portage la Prairie, where there was also a loyal settlement.
They each began to organise an armed force to attack Fort Garry and release their comrades, who were still in prison there.
They made a junction at Headingly, and had scaling ladders and other preparations for attacking Fort Garry.
Schultz brought up about six hundred men, and Mair with the Portage la Prairie contingent, under command of Major Charles Boulton, had about sixty men.
Riel became alarmed, opened a parley with the loyalists, and agreed to deliver up the prisoners, and pledge himself to leave the loyalist settlements alone if he was not attacked.
The prisoners were released and Mair went back to Portage la Prairie, and Schultz to the Selkirk settlement.
Almost immediately Schultz left for Canada with Joseph Monkman, by way of Rainy River to Duluth, while Mair, accompanied by J. J. Setter, started on the long march on snow shoes with dog sleighs over four hundred miles of the then uninhabited waste of Minnesota to St. Paul.
This was in the winter, and the journey in both cases was made on snow shoes and with dog sleighs.
Mair arrived in St. Paul a few days before Schultz.
We heard of their arrival at St. Paul by telegraph, and our committee called a meeting to consider the question of a reception to the refugees.
This meeting was not called by advertisement, so much did we dread the indifference of the public and the danger of our efforts being a failure.
It was decided that we should invite a number to come privately, being careful to choose only those whom we considered would be sympathetic.
This private meeting took place on the 2nd April, 1870.
I was delayed, and did not arrive at the meeting until two or three speeches had been made.
The late John Macnab, the County Attorney, was speaking when I came in; to my astonishment he was averse to taking any action whatever until further information had been obtained.
His argument was that very little information had been received from Fort Garry, and that it would be wiser to wait until the refugees had gone to Ottawa, and had laid their case before the Government, and the Government had expressed their views on the matter, that these men might have been indiscreet, &c. Not knowing that previous speakers had spoken on the same line I sat listening to this, getting more angry every minute.
When he sat down I was thoroughly aroused.
I knew such a policy as that meant handing over the loyal men to the mercies of a hostile element.
I jumped up at once, and in vehement tones denounced the speaker.
I said that these refugees had risked their lives in obedience to a proclamation in the Queen's name, calling upon them to take up arms on her behalf; that there were only a few Ontario men, seventy in number, in that remote and inaccessible region, surrounded by half savages, besieged until supplies gave out.
When abandoned by the officer who had appealed to them to take up arms, they were obliged to surrender, and suffered for long months in prison.
I said these Canadians did this for Canada, and were we at home to be critical as to their method of proving their devotion to our country?
I went on to say that they had escaped and were coming to their own province to tell of their wrongs, to ask assistance to relieve the intolerable condition of their comrades in the Red River Settlement, and I asked, Is there any Ontario man who will not hold out a hand of welcome to these men?
Any man who hesitates is no true Canadian.
I repudiate him as a countryman of mine.
Are we to talk about indiscretion when men have risked their lives?
We have too little of that indiscretion nowadays and should hail it with enthusiasm.
I soon had the whole meeting with me.
When I sat down James D. Edgar, afterwards Sir J. D. Edgar, moved that we should ask the Mayor to call a public meeting.
This was at once agreed to, and a requisition made out and signed, and the Mayor was waited upon, and asked to call a meeting for the 6th.
This was agreed to, Mr. Macnab coming to me and saying I was right, and that he would do all he could to help, which he loyally did.
From the 2nd until the 6th we were busily engaged in asking our friends to attend the meeting.
The Mayor and Corporation were requested to make the refugees the guests of the City during their stay in Toronto, and quarters were taken for them at the Queen's Hotel.
Foster's articles in the _Telegraph_ were beginning to have their influence, and when Schultz, Lynch, Monkman, and Dreever arrived at the station on the evening of the 6th April, a crowd of about one thousand people met them and escorted them to the Queen's.
The meeting was to be held in the St. Lawrence Hall that evening, but when we arrived there with the party, we found the hall crowded and nearly ten thousand people outside.
The meeting was therefore adjourned to the Market Square, and the speakers stood on the roof of the porch of the old City Hall.
The resolutions carried covered three points.
Firstly, a welcome to the refugees, and an endorsation of their action in fearlessly, and at the sacrifice of their liberty and property, resisting the usurpation of power by the murderer Riel; secondly, advocating the adoption of decisive measures to suppress the revolt, and to afford speedy protection to the loyal subjects in the North-West, and thirdly, declaring that "It would be a gross injustice to the loyal inhabitants of Red River, humiliating to our national honour, and contrary to all British traditions for our Government to receive, negotiate, or treat with the emissaries of those who have robbed, imprisoned, and murdered loyal Canadians, whose only fault was zeal for British institutions, whose only crime was devotion to the old flag."
This last resolution, which was carried with great enthusiasm, was moved by Capt.
James Bennett and seconded by myself.
Foster and I had long conferences with Schultz, Mair, and Lynch that evening and next day, and it was decided that I should go to Ottawa with the party, to assist them in furthering their views before the Government.
In the meantime Dr. Canniff and other members of the party had sent word to friends at Cobourg, Belleville, Prescott, etc., to organise demonstrations of welcome to the loyalists at the different points.
A large number of our friends and sympathisers gathered at the Union Station to see the party off to Ottawa, and received them with loud cheers.
Mr. Andrew Fleming then moved, seconded by Mr. T. H. O'Neil, the following resolution, written by Foster, which was unanimously carried:   That we, the citizens of Toronto, in parting with our Red River  guests, beg to reiterate our full recognition of their devotion to,  and sufferings in, the cause of Canada, to emphatically endorse  their manly conduct through troubles sufficient to try the stoutest  heart, and to assure the loyal people of Canada that no minion of the  murderer Riel, no representative of a conspiracy which concentrates  in itself everything a Briton detests, shall be allowed to pass this  platform (should he get so far) to lay insulting proposals at the foot  of a throne which knows how to protect its subjects, and has the means  and never lacks for will to do it.
At Cobourg, where the train stopped for twenty minutes, we were met by the municipal authorities of the town, and a great crowd of citizens, who received the party with warm enthusiasm, and with the heartiest expressions of approval.
This occurred about one o'clock in the morning.
The same thing was repeated at Belleville about three or four a.m., and it was considered advisable for Mr. Mair and Mr. Setter to stay over there to address a great public meeting to be held the next day.
At Prescott, also, the warmest welcome was given by the citizens.
Public feeling was aroused, and we then knew that we would have Ontario at our backs.
On our arrival in Ottawa we found that the Government were not at all friendly to the loyal men, and were not desirous of doing anything that we had been advocating.
The first urgent matter was the expected arrival of Richot and Scott, the rebel emissaries, who were on the way down from St. Paul.
I went to see Sir John A. Macdonald at the earliest moment.
I had been one of his supporters, and had worked hard for him and the party for the previous eight or nine years--in fact since I had been old enough to take an active part in politics; and he knew me well.
I asked him at once if he intended to receive Richot and Scott, in view of the fact that since Sir John had invited Riel to send down representatives, Thomas Scott had been murdered.
To my astonishment he said he would have to receive them.
I urged him vehemently not to do so, to send someone to meet them and to advise them to return.
I told him he had a copy of their Bill of Rights and knew exactly what they wanted, and I said he could make a most liberal settlement of the difficulties and give them everything that was reasonable, and so weaken Riel by taking away the grievances that gave him his strength.
That then a relief expedition could be sent up, and the leading rebels finding their followers leaving them, would decamp, and the trouble would be over.
I pointed out to him that the meetings being held all over Ontario should strengthen his hands, and those of the British section of the Cabinet, and that the French Canadians should be satisfied if full justice was done to the half-breeds, and should not humiliate our national honour.
Sir John did not seem able to answer my arguments, and only repeated that he could not help himself, and that the British Government were favourable to their reception.
I think Sir Stafford Northcote was at the time in Ottawa representing the Home Government, or the Hudson's Bay Company.
Finding that Sir John was determined to receive them I said, "Well, Sir John, I have always supported you, but from the day that you receive Richot and Scott, you must look upon me as a strong and vigorous opponent."
He patted me on the shoulder and said, "Oh, no, you will not oppose me, you must never do that."
I replied, "I am very sorry, Sir John.
I never thought for a moment that you would humiliate us.
I thought when I helped to get up that great meeting in Toronto, and carefully arranged that no hostile resolutions should be brought up against you, that I was doing the best possible work for you; but I seconded a very strong resolution and made a very decided speech before ten thousand of my fellow citizens, and now I am committed, and will have to take my stand."
Feeling much disheartened I left him, and worked against him, and did not support him again, until many years afterwards, when the leaders of the party I had been attached to foolishly began to coquette with commercial union, and some even with veiled treason, while Sir John came out boldly for the Empire, and on the side of loyalty, under the well-known cry, "A British subject I was born, a British subject I will die."
After reporting to Schultz and Lynch we considered carefully the situation, and as Lynch had been especially requested by his fellow prisoners in Fort Garry to represent their views in Ontario, it was decided that he, on behalf of the loyal element of Fort Garry, should put their case before his Excellency the Governor-General himself, and ask for redress and protection.
After careful discussion, I drafted a formal protest, which Lynch wrote out and signed, and we went together to the Government House and delivered it there to one of his Excellency's staff.
Copies of this were given to the Press, and attracted considerable attention.
These so-called delegates, Father Richot and Mr. Scott, were both  among the first organisers and promoters of the outbreak, and have  been supporters and associates of Mr. Riel and his faction from that  time to the present.
When the delegates were appointed at the convention the undersigned,  as well as some fifty others of the loyal people, were in prison on  account of having obeyed the Queen's proclamation issued by Governor  Macdougall.
Riel had possession of the Fort, and most of the arms, and  a reign of terror existed throughout the whole settlement.
When the question came up in the convention, Riel took upon himself to  nominate Father Richot and Mr. Scott, and the convention, unable to  resist, overawed by an armed force, tacitly acquiesced.
Some time after their nomination a rising took place to release the  prisoners, and seven hundred men gathered in opposition to Riel's  government, and, having obtained the release of their prisoners,  and declared that they would not recognise Riel's authority, they  separated.
In the name and on behalf of the loyal people of Red River, comprising  about two-thirds of the whole population, I most humbly but firmly  enter the strongest protest against the reception of Father Richot  and Mr. Scott, as representing the inhabitants of Red River, as they  are simply the delegates of an armed minority.
I have also the honour to request that Your Excellency will be pleased  to direct that, in the event of an audience being granted to these  so-called delegates, that I may be confronted with them and given an  opportunity of refuting any false representations, and of expressing  at the same time the views and wishes of the loyal portion of the  inhabitants.
I have also the honour of informing Your Excellency that Thomas Scott,  one of our loyal subjects, has been cruelly murdered by Mr. Riel and  his associates, and that these so-called delegates were present at the  time of the murder, and are now here as the representatives before  Your Excellency of the council which confirmed the sentence.
I have also the honour to inform Your Excellency, that should Your  Excellency deem it advisable, I am prepared to provide the most ample  evidence to confirm the accuracy and truth of all the statements I  have here made.
I believe this was cabled by his Excellency to the Home Government.
In the meantime Foster and our friends in Toronto were active in the endeavour to prevent the reception of Richot and Scott.
A brother of the murdered Scott happened to be in Toronto, and on his application a warrant was issued by Alexander Macnabb, the Police Magistrate of Toronto, for the arrest of the two delegates, on the charge of aiding and abetting in the murder.
This warrant was sent to the Chief of Police of Ottawa, with a request to have it executed, and the prisoners sent to Toronto.
Foster wrote to me and asked me to see the Chief of Police and press the matter.
When I saw the Chief he denied having received it.
I took him with me to the Post Office, and we asked for the letter containing it.
The officials denied having it.
I said at once that there was some underhand work, and that we would give the information to the Press, and that it would arouse great indignation.
I was requested to be patient until further search could be made.
It was soon found, and I went before the Ottawa Police Magistrate, and proved the warrant, as I knew Mr. Macnabb's signature.
Then the men were arrested.
This was the cause of the Chief of Police denying that he had received it.
Mr. Scott, the complainant, came down to Ottawa, and as we feared Mr. McNabb had no jurisdiction in the case, a new information was sworn out in Ottawa before the Police Magistrate of that City.
Richot and Scott were discharged on the Toronto warrant, and then arrested on the new warrant.
The case was adjourned for some days, but it was impossible to get any definite evidence, as the loyal refugees had been in prison, and knew nothing of what had happened except from the popular report.
Richot and Scott were therefore discharged, and were received by the Government, and many concessions granted to the rebels.
The Canada First group had taken an active part in this agitation, and had urged strongly that Colonel Wolseley (now Field-Marshal Viscount Wolseley) should be sent in command.
We knew that under his directions the expedition would be successfully conducted, and that not only would he have no sympathy with the enemy, but that he would not be a party to any dishonest methods or underhand plotting.
He had commanded the camp of cadets at La Prairie in 1865, and had gained the confidence of them all; afterwards at the camp at Thorold in August and September, 1866, he had nearly all the Ontario battalions of militia pass under his command, so that there was no man in Canada who stood out more prominently in the eyes of the people.
Popular opinion fixed upon Colonel Wolseley with unanimity for the command, and the Government, although very anxious to send Colonel Robertson Ross, Adjutant-General, could not stem the tide, particularly as the Mother Country was sending a third of the expedition and paying a share of the cost, and General Lindsay, who commanded the Imperial forces in Canada, was fully aware of Colonel Wolseley's high qualifications and fitness for the position.
The expedition was soon organised under Colonel Wolseley's skilful leadership, and he started for Port Arthur from Toronto on the 21st May, 1870.
George Brown had asked me to go up with the expedition as correspondent for the _Globe_, and Colonel Wolseley had urged me strongly to accept the offer and go with him.
I should have liked immensely to have taken part in the expedition, but we were doubtful of the good faith of the Government, on account of the great influence of Sir George Cartier and the French Canadian party, and the decided feeling which they had shown in favour of the rebels.
We feared very much that there would be intrigues to betray or delay the expedition.
I was confident that Colonel Wolseley's real difficulty would be in his rear, and not in front of him, and therefore I was determined to remain at home to guard the rear.
From Port Arthur, the first stage of the journey was to Lake Shebandowan, some forty odd miles.
This was the most difficult part of the work.
The Government Road was not finished as had been expected, and Colonel Wolseley was delayed from the end of May until the 16th July, before he was able to despatch any of the troops from McNeill's Bay on Lake Shebandowan.
It will be seen that the expedition was delayed nearly two months in getting over the first fifty miles of the six hundred and fifty by water which lay between Prince Arthur's Landing and Fort Garry.
This was caused by the fact that the first fifty miles was uphill all the way, while the remainder of the journey was mainly downhill.
Sir John A. Macdonald was taken with a very severe and dangerous illness, so that during this important period the control of affairs passed into the hands of Sir George Cartier and the French Canadian party.
This caused great anxiety in Ontario, for we could not tell what might happen.
Our committee were very watchful, and from rumours we heard, we thought it well to be prepared, and on the 13th July, Foster, Grahame and I prepared a requisition to the Mayor to call a public meeting, to protest against any amnesty being granted to the rebels; and getting it well signed by a number of the foremost men in the city, we held it over, to be ready to have the meeting called on the first sign of treachery.
About the 18th July, 1870, Haliburton was at Niagara Falls and by chance saw Lord Lisgar, the Governor-General, and in conversation with him he learned that Sir George Cartier, Bishop Taché, and Mr. Archibald (who had been chosen as Lieutenant-Governor of the new province) were to meet him there in a few days.
Haliburton suspected some plot and telegraphed warning Dr. Schultz at London, Ontario, who sent word to me, and on the 19th we had a meeting of our committee, and arranged at once for the public meeting to be held on the 22nd.
In the Government organ, the _Leader_, of the 19th July was a despatch from Ottawa dated the 18th in the following words:   Bishop Taché will arrive here this evening from Montreal.
The Privy  Council held a special meeting on Saturday.
It is stated on good authority that Sir George Cartier will proceed  with Lieutenant-Governor Archibald to Niagara Falls next Wednesday  to induce His Excellency to go to the North-West via Pembina with  Lieutenant-Governor Archibald and Bishop Taché.
On their arrival, Riel  is to deliver up the Government to them, and the expeditionary troops  will be withdrawn.
On the next day the same paper had an article which, appearing in the official organ of the Government, was most significant.
It concluded in the following words:   So far as the expedition is concerned we have no knowledge that there  is any intention to recall it, but we would not be in the least  surprised if the physical difficulties to be encountered should of  itself make its withdrawal a necessity.
How much better than incurring  any expense in this way would it be for Sir John Young (Lord Lisgar)  to pay a visit to the new Province, there to assume the reins of the  Government on behalf of the Queen, see it passed over properly to Mr.  Archibald, who is so much respected there, and then establish a local  force, instead of endeavouring to forward foot and artillery through  the almost impassable swamps of the long stretch of country lying  between Fort William and Fort Garry.
Should the Government entertain  such an idea as this and successfully carry it out, the time would be  short indeed within which the public would learn to be grateful for  the adoption of so wise a policy.
This gave us the opportunity to take decisive action.
We had already been dreading some such plot which, if successful, would have been disastrous to our hopes of opening up the North-West.
If the expedition had been withdrawn, what security would the loyalist leaders have had as to their safety, after the murder of Scott, and the recognition and endorsation of the murderers?
It was essential that the expedition should go on.
On the first suspicion of difficulty, I had written to Colonel Wolseley and warned him of the danger, and urged him to push on, and not encourage any messages from the rear.
Letters were written to officers on the expedition to impede and delay any messengers who might be sent up, and in case the troops were ordered home, the idea was conveyed to the Ontario men to let the regulars go back, but for them to take their boats and provisions and go on at all hazards.
Hearing on the 19th that Cartier and Taché were coming through Toronto the next night on their way to Niagara, our committee planned a hostile demonstration and were arranging to burn Cartier's effigy at the station.
Something of this leaked out and Lieutenant-Colonel Durie, District Adjutant-General commanding in Toronto, attempted to arrange for a guard of honour to meet Cartier, who was Minister of Militia, in order to protect him.
Lt.-Colonel Boxall, of the 10th Royals, who was spoken to on the subject, said he had an engagement for that evening near the station, of a nature that would make it impossible for him to appear in uniform.
The information was brought to me.
I was at that time out of the force, but I went to Lt.-Colonel Durie, who was the Deputy-Adjutant-General, and told him I had heard of the guard of honour business, and asked him if he thought he could intimidate us and I told him if we heard any more of it, we would take possession of the armoury that night, and that we would have ten men to his one, and if anyone in Toronto wanted to fight it out, we were ready to fight it out on the streets.
He told me I was threatening revolution.
I said, "Yes, I know I am, and we can make it one.
A half continent is at stake, and it is a stake worth fighting for."
Lt.-Colonel Durie telegraphed to Sir George Cartier not to come to Toronto by railway, and he and Bishop Taché got off the train at Kingston.
Taché went to the Falls by way of the States.
Cartier took the steamer for Toronto, arrived at the wharf in the morning, transferred to the Niagara boat, and crossed to the Falls.
This secrecy was all we wanted.
I therefore beg most humbly and respectfully to lay before Your  Excellency, on behalf of those whom I represent, the reasons which  lead us to protest against the leaders of the rebellion being included  in an amnesty and for which we claim that they should be excluded from  its effects.
(1) A general amnesty would be a serious reflection on the loyal  people of the Red River Settlement who throughout this whole affair  have shown a true spirit of loyalty and devotion to their Sovereign  and to British institutions.
Months before Mr. Macdougall left  Canada it was announced that he had been appointed Governor.
He had  resigned his seat in the Cabinet, and had addressed his constituents  prior to his departure.
The people of the Settlement had read these  announcements, and on the publication of his proclamation in the  Queen's name with the royal arms at its head, they had every reason  to consider that the Queen herself called for their services.
Those  services were cheerfully given, they were enrolled in the Queen's name  to put down a rising that was a rebellion--that was trampling under  foot all law and order, and preventing British subjects from entering  or passing through British territory.
For this they were imprisoned  for months; for this they were robbed of all they possessed; and for  this, the crime of obeying the call of his Sovereign, one true-hearted  loyal Canadian was cruelly and foully murdered.
An amnesty to the  perpetrators of these outrages by our Government we hold to be a  serious reflection on the conduct of the loyal inhabitants and a  condemnation of their loyalty.
(2) It is an encouragement of rebellion.
Riel was guilty of treason.
When he refused permission to Mr. Macdougall, a British subject, to  enter a British territory, and drove him away by force of arms, he  set law at defiance and committed an open act of rebellion.
He also  knew that Mr. Macdougall had been nominated Governor, knew that he  had resigned his seat in the Cabinet, knew he had bid farewell to  his constituents; yet he drove him out by force of arms, and when  the Queen's proclamation was issued--for all he knew by the Queen's  authority--he tore it up, scattered the type used in printing it,  defied it, and imprisoned, robbed and murdered those whose only crime  in his eyes was that they had obeyed it.
It may be said that Riel knew  that Mr. Macdougall had no authority to issue a proclamation in the  Queen's name; a statement of this kind would lead to the inference  that it was the result of secret information and of a conspiracy  among some in high positions.
This had sometimes been suspected by  many, but hitherto has never been believed.
An amnesty to Riel and  other leaders would be an endorsation of their acts of treason,  robbery, and murder, and therefore an encouragement to rebellion.
(3) An amnesty is injudicious, impolitic and dangerous, if it includes  the leaders.
Some of those who have been robbed and imprisoned, who  have seen their comrade and fellow prisoner led out and butchered  in cold blood, seeing the law powerless to protect the innocent and  punish the guilty, might in that wild spirit of justice, called  vengeance, take the life of Riel or some other of the leaders.
Should  this unfortunately happen the attempt by means of law to punish the  avenger would be attended with serious difficulty, and would not  receive the support of the loyal people of the Territory, of the  Canadian emigrants who will be pouring in, or of the people of the  older Provinces.
Trouble would arise and further disturbance break  out in the Settlement.
It would be argued with much force that Riel  had murdered a loyal man for no crime but his loyalty and that he was  pardoned, and that when a loyal man taking the law into his own hands  executed a rebel and a murderer in vengeance for a murder, he would  be still more entitled to a pardon, and the result would be that the  law could not be carried out.
When the enforcement of the law would be  an outrage to the sense of justice of the community, the law would be  treated with contempt.
A full amnesty will produce this result, and  bitter feuds and a legacy of internal dissension entailed upon that  country for years to come.
(4) It will destroy all confidence in the administration of law and  maintenance of order.
There could be no feeling of security for life,  liberty, or property in a country where treason, murder, robbery and  other crimes had been openly perpetrated, and afterwards condoned and  pardoned sweepingly by the higher authorities.
(5) The proceedings of the insurgent leaders, previous to the attempt  of Mr. Macdougall to enter the Territory, as well as afterwards,  led many to suspect that Riel and his associates were in collusion  with certain persons holding high official positions.
Although  suspected, it could not be believed.
An amnesty granted now, including  everyone, would confirm these suspicions, preclude the possibility of  dissipating them, and leave a lasting distrust in the honour and good  faith of the Canadian Government.
In respectfully submitting these arguments for Your Excellency's most  favourable consideration, I wish Your Excellency to understand that it  is not the object of this protest to stand in the way of an amnesty  to the great mass of the rebels, but to provide against the pardon of  the ringleaders, those designing men who have inaugurated and kept  alive the difficulties and disturbances in the Red River Settlement,  and who have led on their innocent dupes from one step to another in  the commission of crime by false statements and by appealing to their  prejudices and passions.
This was also given to the Press and widely published.
The meeting for which, as has been said, a requisition had been prepared, was called for the 22nd July, and in addition to the formal posters issued by the acting Mayor on our requisition, Foster and I had prepared a series of inflammatory placards in big type on large sheets, which were posted on the fences and bill boards all over the city.
There were a large number of these placards; some of them read, "Is Manitoba to be reached through British Territory?
Then let our volunteers find a road or make one."
"Shall French rebels rule our Dominion?"
"Orangemen!
is Brother Scott forgotten already?"
"Shall our Queen's Representative go a thousand miles through a foreign country, to demean himself to a thief and a murderer?"
"Will the volunteers accept defeat at the hands of the Minister of Militia?"
"Men of Ontario!
Shall Scott's blood cry in vain for vengeance?"
The public meeting was most enthusiastic, and St. Lawrence Hall was crowded to its utmost limit.
Macdougall moved the first resolution in a vigorous and eloquent speech; it was as follows:   Resolved, that the proposal to recall at the request of the Rebel  Government the military expedition, now on its way to Fort Garry  to establish law and order, would be an act of supreme folly,  an abdication of authority, destructive of all confidence in  the protection afforded to loyal subjects by a constitutional  Government--a death-blow to our national honour, and calls for a  prompt and indignant condemnation by the people of this Dominion.
Mr. Macdougall in supporting this said that:   There were many of our own countrymen there who had been ill-treated  and robbed of their property, and whose lives had been endangered.
Were we to leave these persons--Whites and Indians--without support?
Was this the way that our Government was to maintain its respect?
How  could we expect in that or any other part of the Dominion, that men  would expose themselves to loss of property, imperil their lives,  or incur any hazard whatever, to support a Government that makes  peace with those assailing its authority, and deserts those who have  defended it.
Ex-Mayor F. H. Medcalf seconded this resolution which was unanimously carried.
The second resolution called for the prompt punishment of the rebels.
and seconded by Capt.
James Bennett, both members of the Canada First group.
The third resolution read:   Resolved, in view of the proposed amnesty to Riel and withdrawal of  the expedition, this meeting declares: That the Dominion must and  shall have the North-West Territory in fact as well as in name, and  if our Government, through weakness or treachery, cannot or will not  protect our citizens in it, and recalls our Volunteers, it will then  become the duty of the people of Ontario to organise a scheme of armed  emigration in order that those Canadians who have been driven from  their homes may be reinstated, and that, with the many who desire  to settle in new fields, they may have a sure guarantee against the  repetition of such outrages as have disgraced our country in the past;  that the majesty of the law may be vindicated against all criminals,  no matter by whom instigated or by whom protected; and that we may  never again see the flag of our ancestors trampled in the dust or a  foreign emblem flaunting itself in any part of our broad Dominion.
In moving this resolution, I said, as reported in the Toronto _Telegraph_:   The indignation meeting held three months since has shown the  Government the sentiments of Ontario.
The expedition has been sent  because of these grand and patriotic outbreaks of indignation.
Bishop  Taché had offered to place the Governor-General in possession of  British territory.
Was our Governor-General to receive possession  of the North-West Territory from him?
there were young men from  Ontario under that splendid officer Colonel Wolseley who would place  the Queen's Representative in power in that country in spite of  Bishop Taché and without his assistance (loud cheers).
We will have  that territory in spite of traitors in the Cabinet, and in spite of a  rebel Minister of Militia (applause).
He had said there were traitors  in the Cabinet.
Cartier was a traitor in 1837.
He was often called a  loyal man, but we could buy all their loyalty at the same price of  putting our necks under their heels and petting them continually.
his rebel spirit showed out again; he  whined, and protested, and threatened and talked of the slight to a  million Frenchmen, and the Government yielded to the threat, gave him  a baronetcy, patted him on the back, and now he is loyal again for a  spell (laughter and cheers).
I also pointed out how, if the expedition were recalled, we could, by grants from municipalities, &c., and by public subscription, easily organise a body of armed emigrants who could soon put down the rebels.
This resolution was seconded by Mr. Andrew Fleming and carried with enthusiasm.
Foster seconded, the last resolution:   Resolved that it is the duty of our Government to recognise the  importance of the obligation cast upon us as a people; to strive in  the infancy of our confederation to build up by every possible means  a national sentiment such as will give a common end and aim to our  actions; to make Canadians feel that they have a country which can  avenge those of her sons who suffer and die for her, and to let our  fellow Britons know that a Canadian shall not without protest be  branded before the world as the only subject whose allegiance brings  with it no protection, whose patriotism wins no praise.
The result of this meeting, with the comments of the Ontario Press, had their influence, and Sir George Cartier was obliged to change his policy.
The Governor-General, it was said, took the ground that the expedition was composed partly of Imperial troops, and was under the command of an Imperial officer, and could not be withdrawn without the consent of the Home Government.
Sir George Cartier then planned another scheme by which he hoped to condone the crime which Riel had committed, and protect him and his accomplices from the punishment they deserved.
This plan, of course, we knew nothing of at the time, but it was arranged that Mr. Archibald was to follow the Red River expedition over the route they had taken, for the purpose apparently of going to Fort Garry along with the troops.
It was also planned that, when Mr. Archibald arrived opposite the north-west angle of the Lake of the Woods, he was to turn aside, and land at the point where the Snow Road (so called after Mr.
Snow, the engineer in charge of the work) was to strike the lake, and proceed by land to Fort Garry.
Riel was to send men and horses to meet Mr. Archibald at that point, and he was to be brought into Fort Garry under the auspices of the Rebel Government, and take over the control from them before the expedition could arrive.
This is all clearly shown by two letters from Bishop Taché to Riel, which were found among Riel's papers in Fort Garry after his hurried flight.
They are as follows:            _Letter No.
We cannot therefore arrive together, as I had expected.
I  shall not be alone, because I shall have with me people who come to  aid us.
Mr. Archibald regrets he cannot come by way of Pembina; he  wishes, notwithstanding, to arrive among us, and before the troops.
Therefore he will be glad to have a road found for him either by the  Point des Chenes or the Lac de Roseaux.
I pray you to make enquiry in  this respect, in order to obtain the result that we have proposed.
It  is necessary that he should arrive among and through our people.
I  am well content with this Mr. Archibald.
I have observed that he is  really the man that is needed by us.
Already he seems to understand  the situation and the condition of our dear Red River, and he seems  to love our people.
Have faith then that the good God has blessed us,  notwithstanding our unworthiness.
Be not uneasy; time and faith will  bring us all we desire, and more, which it is impossible to mention,  notwithstanding the expectations of certain Ontarians.
We have some  sincere, devoted and powerful friends.
I think of leaving Montreal on the 8th of August, in which case it is  probable I shall arrive towards the 22nd of the same month.
The letter which I brought has been sent to England, as well as those  which I have written myself, and which I have read to you.
The people of Toronto wished to make a demonstration against me,  and, in spite of the exaggerated statements of the newspapers, they  have never dared to give the number of the persons present (?).
Some persons here at Hamilton wished to speak, but the newspapers  discouraged their zealous efforts.
I am here by chance, and remain, as this is Sunday.
Salute for me Mr.  O.
[O'Donohue?]
and others at the Fort.
Pray much for me.
I do not  forget you.
_Letter No.
I had already something  wherewith to console us when the papers published news dear and  precious to all our friends, and they are many.
I shall leave on  Monday, and with the companions whom I mentioned to Rev.
P. Lestang.
Governor Archibald leaves at the same time, but by another road.
He will arrive before the troops, and I have promised him a good  reception if he comes by the Snow Road.
Governor McTavish's house  will suit him, and we will try to get it for him.
Mother salutes you  affectionately, as also my uncle.
Masson and a crowd of others  send kind remembrances to your good mother and sisters.
Forget not  Mr. O. and others at the Fort.
We have to congratulate you on the  happy result.
The _Globe_ and others are furious at it.
Let them howl  leisurely--they excite but the pity and contempt of some of their  friends.
Excuse me--it is late, and I am fatigued, and to-morrow I  have to do a hard day's work.
These letters prove the plot and the object of it.
There was also a most compromising letter from Sir George Cartier, which was taken away while Colonel Wolseley was a few minutes out of his room, attending to some urgent business.
The suspicion was that it was taken by John H. McTavish, of the Hudson's Bay Company.
It is possible that the word that had been sent to keep back any messages from the rear may have delayed and impeded Mr. Archibald's progress, but whether that be so or not the fact remains that Mr. Archibald lost two days trying to find the point where he was to meet Riel's emissaries, and failing to make the junction he was obliged to follow the circuitous route taken by the troops down the Winnipeg River to Lake Winnipeg, and therefore he did not arrive "among and through the people" of Bishop Taché.
When he reached Fort Garry the Rebels had been driven out, Colonel Wolseley was established in possession, the British flag had been raised over the Fort, and Colonel Wolseley was able to hand over the government of the country to the Queen's representative without the assistance of Riel or his accomplices.
The successful arrival of the expedition, the flight of the rebel leaders, and the confidence that further disorders could not be successfully started, caused numbers of new settlers from Ontario to move into the country, and the progress and development of the whole Territory have since been most remarkable.
Looking at the condition of affairs now, it is hard to realise that a little indifference and carelessness thirty-eight years ago might have delayed the opening up of that great country for two or three generations, and it might easily have happened that it would have been absorbed by the United States.
The discovery of the Pacific Scandal followed in the summer of 1873.
This gave the public the information that the Government had promised to Sir Hugh Allan and a few capitalists the contract for building the Pacific Railway, in consideration of a large contribution of between $300,000 and $400,000 towards the campaign expenses of the Conservative or Government party in the late election.
After a bitter fight over it in the House of Commons, Sir John A. Macdonald, seeing that his Government would be defeated, resigned his position, and Mr. Alexander McKenzie and the Liberals came into power.
At the general election which took place in February, 1874, Mr. McKenzie secured a large majority in the House of Commons.
During the stirring times in the summer of 1870, while the expedition was on its way to Fort Garry, our committee were constantly meeting to discuss matters and often met in my office.
At one meeting it was suggested that we should have a name for our party--the committee had for some time been called jocularly the "Twelve Apostles."
Several names were mentioned, and someone said that Edgar had made a suggestion.
I walked across the hall into Edgar's office, and asked him what he had suggested.
He seemed to have forgotten the exact words, but said, "Canada before all, or Canada First of all."
I said, "That will do: Canada First," and went back to my room and proposed it to the others, and after some discussion it was unanimously decided that we should call ourselves the "Canada First" Party, meaning that we should put Canada first, before every other consideration.
To keep our party free from politics, and to cover our work, we decided to have an organisation, called the North-West Emigration Aid Society, which we could use to give out statements to the public, and to arrange for meetings, &c., to push on our work.
In the autumn of 1870, following the lead given by Haliburton in his lectures, I prepared a lecture on "The Duty of Canadians to Canada," and in 1871 I delivered it at Weston, Belleville, Orillia, Bradford, New Market, Strathroy, Richmond Hill, London, Toronto, Brampton, Halifax (Nova Scotia), Niagara, Wellandport, Dunnville, Chippawa, and in 1872 at Niagara again.
This lecture was a direct appeal in favour of a Canadian National Spirit.
It began by showing that the history of the world was the chronicle of the rise and fall of great nations and empires, of the wars and invasions in which the lust of conquest on the part of rising Powers, and the expiring struggles of waning empires, had been left to the arbitrament of the sword, the nations rising and falling with the changeability of a kaleidoscope.
I pointed out that all the great nations possessed a strong national spirit, and lost their position and power as soon as that spirit left them, and urged all Canadians to think first of their country--to put it before party or personal considerations--pointing out that this sentiment, in all dominant races, exhibited itself in the same way, in the patriotic feeling in the individual, causing him to put the interest of the country above all selfish considerations, and "to be willing to undergo hardships, privations, and want, and to risk life and even to lay down life on behalf of the State."
After showing a number of ways in which Canadians in ordinary life could help Canada, I went on to say:   If our young men habituate themselves to thinking of the country and  its interests in everyday life, it will become in time part of their  nature, and when great trials come upon us, the individual citizens  will more readily be inclined to make the greatest sacrifices for the  State.
Haliburton, in his lecture on "The Men of the North," made use of a paragraph which I quoted.
It shows the spirit which animated the Canada First Party:   Whenever we lower those we love into the grave, we entrust them to  the bosom of our country as sacred pledges that the soil that is thus  consecrated by their dust shall never be violated by a foreign flag or  the foot of a foe, and whenever the voice of disloyalty whispers in  our ear, or passing discontent tempts us to forget those who are to  come after us, or those who have gone before us, the leal, the true,  and the good, who cleared our forests, and made the land they loved  a heritage of plenty and peace to us and to our children, a stern  voice comes echoing on through thirty centuries; a voice from the old  sleepers of the pyramids; a voice from a mighty nation of the past  that long ages has slumbered on the banks of the Nile: "Accursed be he  who holds not the ashes of his fathers sacred, and forgets what is due  from the living to the dead."
I urged a confidence in our future as another great necessity:   We have everything in a material point of view to make Canada a great  country--unlimited territory fertile and rich, an increasing hardy  and intelligent population, immense fisheries, minerals of every  description, ships and sailors; all we further require is a moral  power, pride in our country and confidence in its future, confidence  in ourselves and in each other.
It has been sometimes said by those who knew little of the aspirations of our party that there was a feeling in favour of independence among us.
The extract quoted from Haliburton's lecture shows how true he was to the cause of a United Empire.
I shall quote the concluding paragraphs of my lecture, which are very definite upon the point:   It must not be supposed that the growth of a national sentiment will  have any tendency to weaken the connection between this country and  Great Britain.
On the other hand, it will strengthen and confirm  the bond of union.
Unfortunately England has reached that phase  when her manufacturing and commercial community have attained such  wealth and affluence, have become so wrapped up in the success of  their business, and have acquired such a pounds, shillings, and pence  basis in considering everything, that national sentiment is much  weakened, in fact sentiment of any kind is sneered at and scoffed  at as being behind the age.
This school of politicians, fearing the  expense of maintaining a war to defend Canada, calculating that in a  monetary point of view we are not a source of revenue to them, speak  slightingly of us, and treat the sentiment of affection that we bear  to the Mother land with contempt.
Nothing could be more irritating to a high-spirited people.
We have  the gratifying reflection, however, that the more we rise in the scale  of nations, the more will this class desire to keep us, until at  length every effort will be made to retain our affection and secure  our fealty.
It is our duty therefore to push our way onwards and  upwards, to show England that soon the benefits of the connection in a  material as well as a moral point of view will be all in her favour.
I hope the day will come when the British Empire will be united into  one great power or confederation of great nations, a confederation  for the purpose of consolidating power as to foreign countries, and  on all international questions; and rest assured, if we Canadians are  only true to ourselves, the day will come when Canada will be not only  the largest, but the most populous, the most warlike, and the most  powerful of all the members of that confederation, if not the most  powerful nation in the world.
I delivered this lecture, with a few slight changes, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on the 29th April, 1871, and the feeling then in that Province against Canada and the name Canadian was so strong, that I changed the title to that of "The Duty of our Young Men to the State."
Haliburton was then living in Halifax, and he had interested the late Principal George M. Grant, of Queen's University, in our movement.
Grant was then a young minister in charge of a Presbyterian Church in Halifax.
He took an active part in getting up the meeting, which was largely attended, and my lecture was favourably received.
That was my first meeting with Grant, and afterwards we were often closely associated in the movement in favour of Imperial Unity, and were warm friends as long as he lived.
I shall often have to refer to him in the following pages.
Mair had been doing good work, delivering a splendid lecture in Belleville in 1870.
Haliburton had been delivering his lectures, and I mine; but I felt that Foster, who had done such splendid work in the editorial columns of the _Telegraph_, should also prepare a lecture.
I kept urging him until at last he began to write one.
He used to bring two or three pages at a time down and read them to me in my office.
By this time we had got thirty or forty members together and had formed, as I have said, the North-West Emigration Aid Society, of which Joseph Macdougall, son of the Hon.
Macdougall, was secretary.
Macdougall was then one of our members.
On one occasion, when the Society had issued a paper for publication, Mr. Macdougall had induced his son to put in additional matter that had not come before the Society.
This did not please Foster, who asked six members of the Society to sign a requisition calling a general meeting to consider the matter.
It was then decided that any publications issued by the Society were to be brought before them first for approval.
It was not many weeks after this incident that Foster brought in the concluding pages of his lecture and read them to me.
I do not believe any of the others knew anything about it.
When he had read it all to me, I said to him, "What are you going to call it?"
He said, "I think our motto, 'Canada First.'"
I thought that a good idea, and he wrote "Canada First" at the head of it.
I then asked him where he was going to deliver it.
He was a very shy fellow and he replied, "I am not going to deliver it."
I said, "Oh yes, you must.
We will call a meeting."
I knew we could get up a large public meeting, and I wanted him to agree to read it, but he positively refused.
I then said, "You can read it here before our Society, and then we can have it published in the papers"; and I wrote on the top of it in pencil the words "Delivered before the North-West Emigration Aid Society by Mr. W. A.
Foster," and I showed it to him and said, "That will look very well, and I am sure Mr. Brown will publish it."
Foster hesitated, but at last said, "Will you go and show it to Mr. Brown, and ask him, if I read it before the Society, whether he will publish it?"
I agreed to do this.
I went to see the Hon.
Whether Mr. Brown forgot, or whether he thought he had some good matter for his paper and wished to publish it before any other paper got wind of it or not, or whether he thought the chronological order of events was a matter of no moment, I cannot say.
The result was, however, that the second or third morning after, Foster came into my office early, in a great state of excitement, and told me that the lecture was published in full in the _Globe_ that morning, and that it had copied in large type the pencil memo, which I had written at the top, "Delivered before the North-West Emigration Aid Society by Mr. W. A.
Foster was very much troubled about it after his action about Macdougall, but our friends were so pleased with it that no one complained.
This lecture was soon after published in pamphlet form and had a very wide circulation throughout Canada.
It was printed in the Memorial Volume to W. A.
Foster which was published soon after his death.
I opposed this strenuously, saying that the instant we did so the newspapers on both sides of politics would attack us, and that they would have something tangible to attack.
The late Daniel Spry urged me very strongly that we should come out openly.
I opposed the idea and refused to take any part in it, fearing that it would at the time injure the influence we were beginning to exert.
Foster and I discussed the matter at great length, and my suggestion was that we should go on as we had been going, and that if we ever wished to hold public meetings Dr. Canniff, one of the "Twelve Apostles," and the oldest of them, the author of "The Early Settlement of Upper Canada," would always make an excellent chairman, and not being a party man would not arouse hostility.
I said, "If we organise a party and appoint a particular man to lead, we shall be responsible for everything he says," and repeated that the party Press would attack him bitterly and injure the cause, which was all we cared for.
Foster supported my views, and during 1872 and 1873 we kept quiet, watching for any good opportunities of doing service to the country.
In the general election of 1872 I was requested by the Hon.
George Brown and Alexander McKenzie to go up to Algoma, and either get some candidate to run or run myself in the Reform interest against Lt.-Col. Fred C. Cumberland, the sitting member for the House of Commons.
I arrived at Bruce Mines on the same steamer with Col. Cumberland, and he called a meeting of the electors the same evening and asked me to attend.
I did not know anyone in the place, but Mr. Brown had given me a letter to Mr. Peter Nicholson, which I presented to him and told him I was going to the meeting.
He urged me not to go, but I insisted.
He then said he would get a few friends, so that I would not be alone.
Col. Cumberland spoke for about an hour, and then called upon me to speak, he well knowing I had come up to work against him.
I asked him to introduce me to the meeting, as I did not know anyone; this he did in a very satirical manner.
I then spoke for an hour, and attacked the Government very vehemently for their Red River policy and on other points.
Very soon the whole meeting was with me, and after it was over the people nearly all came over to Mr. Nicholson's store and insisted that I should contest the constituency, and, finding I could not get anyone else to run, I consented.
Col. Cumberland withdrew the next day from the contest, and the Hon.
John B. Robinson was brought out in his place.
After a hard struggle I was defeated by a majority of eighty votes.
I fully expected to be beaten; in fact, I was surprised the majority was not much greater.
There was a very large amount of money spent against me; so large that there was an inquiry in the House afterwards, and something like $6,000, spent by the Northern Railway Company against me, was, I believe, refunded to the company by the directors or the Conservative party.
This was my only attempt to enter Parliament.
In November, 1873, I left for England and did not return until the 2nd February, 1874.
Shortly after leaving an election came on, and the late Chief Justice Thomas Moss was contesting West Toronto for the House of Commons.
Foster thought it would be good policy, as Moss was sympathetic with our views, to organise the "Canada First" party as a political organisation and as such to support Moss.
He at once took steps to organise it, and with the old organisation and a large number of others the National Association was established.
This was on the 6th January, 1874.
Of our old group there were W. A.
Foster, Dr. Canniff, Hugh Scott, Joseph E. Macdougall, C. E. English, G. M. Rae, Richard Grahame, James R. Roaf, Thomas Walmsley, George R. Kingsmill; and besides these a number of new associates--W. H. Howland, R. W. Elliott, J. M. Trout, Wm.
Badenach, W. G. McWilliams, James Michie, Nicol Kingsmill, Hugh Blain, Jos.
A. Donovan, W. B. McMurrich, G. W. Badgerow, C. W. R. Biggar, W. H. Fraser, J. G. Ridout, W. E. Cornell, W. G. Mutton, C. W. Dedrickson, J. Crickmore, Wm.
Hessin, J. Ritchie, Jr., R. G. Trotter, A. S. Irving, A. Howell, R. H. Gray, and Dr. Roseburgh.
Foster did most of the work, and I have no doubt drafted the constitution and the platform.
He remembered what I had said, and provided that the movement should be guided by an Executive Committee of twelve, without any president or vice-president.
The platform was adopted as follows:   (1) British Connection, Consolidation of the Empire, and in the  meantime a voice in treaties affecting Canada.
(2) Closer trade relations with the British West India Islands, with a  view to ultimate political connection.
(3) Income Franchise.
(4) The Ballot, with the addition of compulsory voting.
(5) A Scheme for the Representation of Minorities.
(6) Encouragement of Immigration, and Free Homesteads in the Public  Domain.
(7) The imposition of duties for Revenue, so adjusted as to afford  every possible encouragement to Native Industry.
(8) An improved Militia System, under the command of trained Dominion  Officers.
(9) No Property Qualifications in Members of the House of Commons.
(10) The Reorganisation of the Senate.
(11) Pure and Economic Administration of Public Affairs.
It will be noticed that the very first plank in the platform was "British Connection, Consolidation of the Empire, and in the meantime a voice in treaties affecting Canada."
This certainly was not favouring either Independence or Annexation, and of the other ten items nearly every point has since been carried into practice.
At the first public meeting, held on 6th December, 1873, Mr. W. H. Howland was in the chair.
He knew very little of our objects or aspirations.
He was the son of Sir Wm.
P. Howland, who had been a citizen of the United States, and had only settled in Canada some fourteen years before W. H. Howland was born.
Howland was a most useful and patriotic citizen, and during a very long life did great service to Canada in various capacities, but neither he nor his son had the inherited traditions of loyalty to the Empire which animated the older Canadians, and the result was that at this first meeting the chairman's remarks struck a discordant note in the minds of the majority of the members of the National Association.
"He held that there was too much toadyism to English aristocratic usages in this country.
There was too much toadyism to titles.
We would have no aristocracy in this country but the aristocracy of merit, no order but the order of merit, and the sooner the English Government recognised the fact that the adornment of a man in this country with the feelings they entertained was rather an insult than an honour to our people, the sooner would they appreciate our real sentiment.
Many Canadians who had gone home had, he held, brought us into contempt by their toadying."
The result of this speech was most unfortunate.
I believe he did not speak for more than fifteen or twenty minutes, but in that time he had practically killed the movement as a political organisation.
The committee were dissatisfied and disheartened; the political Press seized at once on the weak points, and attacked the organisation for advocating Independence, and charged it with being disloyal in its objects.
Mr. Goldwin Smith then joined it and hoped to use it for the purpose of advocating the disruption of the tie which bound Canada to the Empire.
The National Club was founded by this organisation at this time.
I returned to Canada shortly after the movement had been launched and was at once appealed to by my old comrades to join and help to redeem the party from the taint of Independence which it had acquired through the unfortunate speech of W. H. Howland in introducing it to public notice.
I declined positively, telling them that it was too late, and it would have to die a natural death.
As a political party it lost strength and soon died, its demise being hastened by the fact that it gave encouragement to a few young men to come out openly in favour of Canadian Independence, supported as they were by the great social and literary status of Mr. Goldwin Smith, who has always been willing to assist any movement likely to injure the unity of the British Empire.
I joined it about a year after its foundation, and was President of it in the years 1883 and 1884, and during the existence of the Club it has been the centre of the sentiment "Canada First within the Empire," which has been the dominant sentiment of the Canadian people for the last twenty years.
Mr. Goldwin Smith in the early years of the Club inaugurated a series of dinners among the members where fifteen or twenty of us would dine together and then discuss some public question of interest.
These dinners were popular, and Foster and I were generally present.
On one occasion Mr. Goldwin Smith gave out as the subject for discussion the question as to whether "Annexation or Independence would be the best future for Canada."
Mr. Smith was in the chair at one end of the long table, at which about twenty or perhaps more were seated, and he opened the discussion by pointing out some arguments for and against each alternative, leaving it for the members to discuss as to which would be the best.
I was in the vice-chair at the other end of the table, and the speaking began on one side of Mr. Smith, and came down that side of the table one after the other to me.
I was struck with the bad effect such a discussion would have, in encouraging Canadians to argue in favour of either Independence or Annexation, and when it came to my turn I simply said that I could not argue in favour of either Independence or Annexation, that I was vehemently opposed to both, and that if ever the time came that either should have to be seriously discussed, I would only argue it in one way, and that was on horseback with my sword.
As I then commanded the cavalry in Toronto and had sworn to bear true allegiance to her Majesty, it was the natural way for me to put it.
I sat down the moment I had made this statement and the discussion went on.
My remarks were received as if I had spoken jocularly, but I think many of those present sympathised with my way of looking at it.
Mr. Goldwin Smith saw that I had punctured the scheme, and referred to my remarks in the next issue of his _Bystander_ for October, 1880, in the following terms, which are in his best style:   In Canada we have some curious remnants of the idea, dominant  everywhere in days gone by, and still dominant in Islam, that  intolerance on certain questions is a duty and virtue.
The good  St. Louis of France used to say that he would never argue with a  heretic who doubted Papal doctrine, but give him six inches of cold  steel; and we have lately been told that among ourselves there are  questions which are to be debated only sword in hand.
There are  some special factors in our political composition, such as United  Empire Loyalism, Orangeism, and the surviving sentiment of Anglican  Establishmentarianism, which may explain the phenomenon without  disparagement to our intellectual civilisation.
In a speech at a dinner of my regiment not long after, I spoke clearly to them on the subject--and on the same lines.
My views were received with great enthusiasm.
For several years matters progressed slowly, a few young men advocating Independence, among whom were E. E. Sheppard and Charles G. D. Roberts.
Mr. Norris and others were writing on the same line.
Sheppard, who then edited the _Evening News_ in Toronto, was the ablest of these advocates, and carried on his campaign with great vigour and ability.
He designed a new flag and hoisted it over the _News_ office.
In 1884 the Independence agitation was probably more in evidence than at any period before or since.
That year was the centennial of the arrival of the United Empire Loyalists in Upper Canada, and it was decided to hold a series of celebrations at Adolphustown, Toronto, and Niagara in commemoration of the foundation of the Province.
1884 was also the 50th Anniversary of the establishment of Toronto as a city, and the celebration of the two events was combined in meetings and festivities which lasted several days.
On Dominion Day there was a great review of the Active Militia with regiments from various parts of the Province, and one from Montreal.
This large force paraded through the principal streets to the Queen's Park, where they were reviewed, and then they marched to the Exhibition Buildings, where the officers and men were entertained at dinner.
At the officers' dinner, Mayor Boswell, Lieut.-Governor John B. Robinson, and I made the principal speeches.
We offer the Cartwright party and their organ the following nuts to  crack, taken from the report of the military banquet on Tuesday, to  which we referred in our last issue.
Mayor Boswell was next honoured.
In responding, his Worship referred  to the attempt which was being made in some quarters to introduce the  question of independence or annexation into Canadian politics.
He  regretted this very much, but he was certain that no member of the  Militia force would ever entertain such a proposal.
Lieut.-Colonel G. T. Denison, in proposing the toast of the visiting  corps, also referred to the same matter.
He said that the Militia of  Canada would remain true to its Queen and country.
Before independence  or annexation could be brought about, he said, "Many of us will  have to be placed under the sod."
His remarks were received with  enthusiastic cheers, again and again renewed.
The Lieutenant-Governor, in proposing the toast of Lieut.-Colonel  Robert B. Denison, Deputy-Adjutant-General, also touched on the  absurdity of the independence or annexation question.
He felt  satisfied that if it became a political issue, there would not be a  constituency in Canada that would return a man in favour of it.
The United Empire Loyalist Centennial celebration took place in the Pavilion, Toronto, on the 3rd July--the same day that the above article appeared.
It was a very successful meeting, there being representative loyalists from all over Ontario.
Canniff was in the chair.
The speakers were the Hon.
Senator G. W. Allan, Chief Green (a Mohawk Indian, of Tyendinaga), Lieut.-Colonel George T. Denison, and Bishop Fuller, of Niagara."
My speech was mainly directed against the Independence movement.
I showed how Canadians had always stood by British connection, and went on to say:   From whom comes this cry for independence?
Not from the real  Canadians, but from a few hangers-on of the newspaper Press--a few  wanderers and Bohemians--men who have lived indifferently in Canada  and the States, and have never been satisfied anywhere--men without  an atom of stake in the country.
And do you think that the people of  Canada are going to submit themselves to the guidance of such men?
The Independence party in Canada can almost be counted on one's  fingers and toes.
The movement did not amount to anything, and the  moment it did the real feeling of the country would manifest itself.
I was attacked very bitterly by the few Independence papers on account of this speech, and the attacks continued for nearly six weeks.
I was invited to address the United Empire Loyalist Centennial celebration at Niagara, which took place on the 14th August, 1884, and then replied to some of the arguments used by them.
On the question of national sentiment I said:   Sometimes it is said by strangers and aliens amongst us that we  Canadians have no national sentiment, that if we were independent we  would have more of it, and it is the fashion to speak loudly of the  national spirit of the citizens of the United States.
I take issue  on this point, and on behalf of our people I say that the pride of  the native Canadian in his country is quite equal to the pride of the  Yankee in his, while the willingness to defend it in case of need is  far greater in the Canadian.
The strongest national sentiment that has yet been exhibited in the  States was shown by the Southern people in their gallant struggle to  destroy the Union.
The national spirit shown by the Northerners where  the bounties rose to about $1,800 a man, where patriotism consisted  in hiring a man to go and fight while the citizen took a contract to  supply the soldiers, as has been well said by their celebrated divine,  Dr. Talmage, "With rice that was worm-eaten, with biscuits that were  mouldy, with garments that were shoddy, with meat that was rank, with  horses that stumbled in the charge, and with tents that sifted the  rain into the faces of the exhausted."
The patriotism shown by three  thousand Yankee Militia almost in sight of this spot in 1812, when  they refused to cross at Queenston to aid their comrades, whom our  volunteers shortly afterwards cut to pieces under their eyes, was very  different from the patriotism of the Canadians who crossed the river  and captured Detroit, or those who fought at Chrysler's Farm, or those  who drove back Hampton at Chateauguay.
Can we call to mind the Canadians who came back to Canada from every  State in the Union to aid in defending her from the Fenians without  feeling that we have in our people a strong national sentiment?
Wanderers and Bohemians, strangers and tramps may, because we are  not traitors to our Government and our country, say that we have  no national sentiment; they may not see or feel or appreciate the  patriotic feeling of the Canadians, but we Canadians know that it is  there.
The Militia force is one proof of it, a finger-post to point  out to all, that we intend to be a free people on this continent,  and that, our liberties can only be taken from us after a desperate  struggle.
These wanderers and Bohemians, with the charming impudence of the  three tailors of Tooley Street, speak of themselves as the people of  Canada.
It is the fashion of men of their type always to talk loudly  of the people, as if they were the people.
But who are the people?
The people of this country are the farmers who own the soil, who have  cleared the fields, who till them, and who produce the food that feeds  us.
The people of Canada are the workers who work in her factories,  who carry on her trade, who sail her ships and spread her commerce,  the citizens who build her cities and work in them.
These are the  people of Canada, not the few agitators who serve no good purpose, and  whose absence would be a relief if they went back to the neighbouring  Republic from which many of them have drifted in to us.
The result of these demonstrations so directly appealing to the sentiments and feelings of the loyal element, which formed the vast majority of the people, discouraged the disloyal element, and for a year matters were rather quiet.
In March, 1885, the whole country was aroused over the outbreak of the North-West Rebellion, and troops from all over Canada were sent to aid in putting down the rebellion and re-establishing the Queen's authority.
One regiment came from Nova Scotia.
The result of the affair was to consolidate the Provinces into a Dominion, in a way that was never felt before.
This put the Independence movement quite out of sight, and during 1886, and until May, 1887, matters remained dormant.
There was a very large Irish population in Canada, and through their representatives in our House of Commons and in the local legislatures they pressed for resolutions in favour of the policy of Home Rule.
The people of Canada were not generally favourable to the movement, but the politicians on both sides, who were anxious to obtain the Irish vote, did not hesitate to support the Home Rule resolutions; little caring for the interests of the Mother Country or the Empire, so long as their political opponents did not obtain any advantage in the matter.
The resolutions were carried with remarkable unanimity.
I was much annoyed, and wrote to Lord Salisbury telling him to pay no attention to the addresses of our politicians.
I assured him that the silent masses of the Canadian people were on his side on that subject, but unfortunately there was no way in which the silent masses could make their views known.
The apparent unanimity of feeling in Canada, as shown by the action of Governments and Parliaments, deceived the Irish Nationalists, and to emphasise their power in Canada, Mr. Wm.
This was because he was an Irish landlord and had evicted some of his tenants.
This was cabled across, and a day or two after I met Colonel Gzowski (afterwards Sir Casimir Gzowski) on the street, and he told me that Lord Lansdowne was coming to Toronto in a few days, and as O'Brien was coming out, he thought we in Toronto should see that Lord Lansdowne got a friendly reception.
I saw the opportunity at once.
I felt the silent masses might have a chance to speak out, and said, "Leave that to me: we will give him a great reception."
Among other things it was feared that the few disaffected might resort to violence against the Governor-General.
A few days later, on the 26th April, 1887, I attended the St. George's Society Annual Banquet, where I responded to the toast of the Army, Navy, and Volunteers.
The presidents of most of the benevolent and patriotic societies of the city were guests at the dinner.
The Premier, Sir Oliver Mowat, sat next to me; the Mayor was present also, and a very large number of prominent citizens.
I saw what an opening there was to start a movement in favour of the Governor-General, and spoke in short as follows: I was speaking on behalf of the Army, Navy and Volunteers, and drew attention to the fact that a great deal depended upon the Volunteers--that only a few years before we had to turn out, and go to the Niagara frontier to defend our country against an invasion of Fenians from the United States.
I said that the Irish of that country had subscribed large sums of money, Irish servant girls giving liberally out of their savings, to provide funds to organise armed forces, to buy rifles and bayonets and swords and ammunition, to be used in attacking a peaceful and inoffensive country in order to devastate our fields, to shoot down our people, and rob us of our property.
I pointed out that I and my command had been sent to Fort Erie, and that some of my comrades in the Queen's Own and other Volunteer corps had been shot down, and many wounded, before we drove the enemy out of the country.
I thanked them for proposing the toast of the "Volunteers," but went on to say, there was one thing, however, that was very annoying and humiliating to us.
The Fenians, having failed to defeat us, were still carrying on their campaign against our Empire.
Money was being collected as usual in the United States in large quantities, but instead of being used in the purchase of arms and munitions of war, it was being expended in sending traitors into the British House of Commons, and in maintaining them there to destroy the Union, and make the first rift in our Empire.
"Fancy, gentlemen, the feelings of those of us who went to the front, who risked our lives, who had our comrades killed in opposing these men, when we see our politicians in our Houses of Parliament, for wretched party purposes, clasping hands with the enemies of our Empire, and passing resolutions of sympathy and support to them in their efforts to injure our nation.
These resolutions are an insult to our Volunteers, and a shame and disgrace to our country," and I sat down.
This was received with uproarious applause.
The people jumped to their feet and cheered and waved their table napkins, many even got upon their chairs, and shouted themselves hoarse.
Sir Oliver Mowat (then Mr. Mowat), who had supported one of these resolutions in the local House shortly before, and was Premier, said to me when the cheering subsided and I could hear him, "That was a very powerful speech you made."
I replied, "Do you think so?"
He said, "It was a very strong speech."
I answered, "Was it?
I tried so hard to be moderate."
He laughed and said, "You did, did you?"
He never had any more such resolutions in his House.
When the dinner was over and the guests were leaving, I stood near the door and was surrounded by men approving of my speech.
I picked out the men I wanted--the Mayor, the presidents of societies, colonels of regiments, &c.--and asked them to wait as I wished to speak to them.
When the group had gathered I said to them, "I did not speak as I did for nothing.
Lord Lansdowne is coming here very soon.
O'Brien is coming from Ireland to drive him out of Canada.
We must arrange for such a reception to Lord Lansdowne as no Governor-General ever had in Toronto, and I want you all to agree to serve on a committee to organise it; and I hope the Mayor will take the chair, and send out notices for the meeting."
All at once agreed heartily.
When the meeting was held to arrange the plan for the reception, a number of those present wished a great procession to be organised of societies and the city regiments in uniform, &c. I knew that the object of the Irish Nationalists was to create the belief that the people of Canada, with the exception of the official classes, &c., were not on the side of the Governor-General, and that he would have to be guarded by police and soldiers, and insisted that not one man in uniform should be seen--that the people, as the people, should take the matter into their own hands, and escort the Governor-General.
It was a most difficult task to carry the committee with me, but I was determinedly persistent and at last carried my point.
A small committee was appointed to arrange details, and the reception was organised with the greatest care.
The Volunteer regiments were pledged to turn out in plain clothes, with walking-sticks; the societies also agreed to be out, the Orangemen did their part, the lawyers were canvassed to be in the streets, and all were asked to act as private detectives, and watch carefully any attempt to throw stones by any disaffected parties if there were any.
The citizens illuminated their houses and shops on the route from North Toronto Station through Yonge and King Streets to Government House.
Members of the Toronto Hunt Club, mounted and in plain clothes, formed an escort; but, what was not known to the public, twenty-five picked men of my corps, the Governor-General's Body Guard, in plain clothes, with Lieut.-Colonel Merritt, my adjutant, in charge, rode as members of the Hunt Club, along with them, and guarded the carriage of his Excellency.
About four hundred men of the Queen's Own, all in plain clothes, marched along the street alongside the carriage.
The Orange body arranged for a torchlight procession with about a thousand torches, and the police were entirely withdrawn from the streets on which the procession marched.
I do not believe anyone was ever more carefully guarded, for the people as a mass took it in hand themselves.
On the morning of the day on which his Excellency was to arrive, I learned that the General commanding had ordered a guard of honour to meet him at the station.
I went at once to the Mayor, and we went together to see the Governor's military secretary, and urged him to ask his Excellency to countermand the order and dispense with the guard.
This was done, and no man in uniform was to be seen.
The reception was a remarkable success.
The streets were filled with most enthusiastic crowds, and no Governor-General ever made such an entry into Toronto.
The people took him to Government House, and the whole neighbourhood and the carriage drive were packed with cheering crowds.
Lord Lansdowne stood up in his carriage at the door, and made a speech thanking the people, and he must have felt that he was among friends.
A few days later a great meeting was held in the Queen's Park, when a number of prominent citizens made speeches condemning Mr. O'Brien's proposed visit to Toronto and resolutions were passed in that sense.
The Mayor, on behalf of the citizens, sent a telegram to O'Brien requesting him not to come to Toronto.
O'Brien and his people persisted, however, and called a public meeting in the Queen's Park for the 17th May.
There was a very large gathering, probably ten or twelve thousand people, and O'Brien and his companion, Mr. Kilbride (one of Lord Lansdowne's evicted tenants), were carefully guarded by the police.
The Irish party, who comprised probably one-tenth of the crowd, organised the meeting, and Mr. O'Brien, with several Yankee reporters around him, began to speak.
The University students had planned to start singing, and the moment he began, the crowd broke out with "God Save the Queen."
Cheers were then called for Lord Lansdowne, Lord Salisbury, Lord Hartington, and Joseph Chamberlain.
Then the singing began again; "Rule, Britannia" was sung by the great masses.
Again cheers for the four statesmen already mentioned, then alternately "God Save the Queen," cheers, and "Rule, Britannia."
No one could hear a word of O'Brien's speech.
This went on until he ceased to attempt to speak.
Mr. Kilbride then stood up.
The students led the crowd in a refrain, "Pay your rint, pay your rint, pay your rint, you thief," and the people shouted this over and over again, and he, unable to be heard, had to cease, and the meeting ended by some local man trying to say a few words.
While moving through the crowd studying the temper of the people, I saw two or three incidents which showed me that there was a very dangerous and ugly spirit among the loyalists, and I become anxious lest the mob should get beyond all control.
I went to the Chief of Police, who had a large force of policemen and an escort of mounted police, to guard the carriage of the visitors, and told him he would have a difficulty in getting O'Brien away without injury.
Being a Police Commissioner, I advised him to get those in charge of the meeting to put up someone to speak as soon as Kilbride finished, and to take O'Brien and Kilbride quietly off the platform to the back, hurry them into the carriage, and drive off before the crowd should discover it.
This was done, and they had barely got clear when the crowd, seeing they were going, chased them and endeavoured to stone them.
Fortunately they had a start, and driving rapidly escaped without injury.
I had told the Chief of Police not to allow O'Brien to go anywhere on the streets without a strong police guard, for, as I told him, "I do not want him hurt for one thing, and, on the other hand, I should be very sorry that the idea should get abroad that he could walk the streets of Toronto (under the circumstances) without protection."
The following evening, O'Brien and his party of three or four friends, including one Yankee reporter, started from the hotel in the dusk to walk round a block, and would not wait for the police escort for which the police sergeant was sending.
The party had not gone two hundred yards when the crowds began to gather and follow them.
They were pelted with stones and eggs, the New York reporter being badly cut by a stone.
They escaped with difficulty back to the hotel.
In Hamilton, Kingston, and other places O'Brien was also mobbed and chased and was obliged to hide.
He then left the country, while Lord Lansdowne, who remained, received a few days later a remarkable ovation on his return to Ottawa.
I left for England the day after O'Brien's meeting (on my vacation) and a day or two after my arrival in London I was dining at Lord Salisbury's, where I met Mr. Balfour, then Chief Secretary for Ireland.
They were interested in hearing the particulars.
I told Lord Salisbury that the "silent masses" had spoken out, and with no uncertain sound.
Both he and Mr. Balfour said that O'Brien's reception in Canada had helped the passage of the Coercion Bill through the House of Commons, for it proved that the statement of the Nationalists that every country in the world was on their side was not quite accurate.
The Right Hon.
W. E. Forster was the moving spirit, and the first President of the organisation.
The objects of the League are clearly laid down in the following resolutions defining its nature and objects, which were passed at an adjourned conference held in London on the 18th November, 1884:   That a Society be now formed to be called "The Imperial Federation  League."
That the object of the League be to secure by Federation the permanent  Unity of the Empire.
That no scheme of Federation should interfere with the existing rights  of local Parliaments as regards local affairs.
That any scheme of Imperial Federation should combine, on an equitable  basis, the resources of the Empire for the maintenance of common  interests and adequately provide for an organised defence of common  rights.
That the League use every constitutional means to bring about the  object for which it is formed and invite the support of men of all  political parties.
That the membership of the League be open to any British subject who  accepts the principles of the League, and pays a yearly registration  fee of not less than one shilling.
That donations and subscriptions be invited for providing means for  conducting the business of the League.
That British subjects throughout the Empire be invited to become  members, and to form and organise Branches of the League which may  place their representatives on the General Committee.
It will be seen that the main object of this League was to secure by Federation the permanent Unity of the Empire.
The existing rights of local Parliaments as to local affairs were to be preserved, but the resources of the Empire were to be combined to maintain common interests, and to provide for an organised defence of common rights.
That was the whole scheme in a nutshell, to form a Federated Parliament, which would not interfere with local affairs, but would have power to use the resources of the Empire for common defence.
No other object was given to the public.
It was really formed to secure colonial contributions to Imperial Defence.
The first branch of the Canadian League was organised at the small town of Ingersoll in Ontario in May, 1886, principally through the exertions of Mr. J. Castell Hopkins, then a young man twenty-two years of age, and a junior clerk in the agency of the Imperial Bank of that place.
Mr. M. Walsh was elected President, and Mr. Hopkins Secretary.
Mr. Hopkins has ever since been an active and industrious supporter of the movement.
An influential branch was inaugurated in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in December, 1886, of which his Grace Archbishop O'Brien was one of the foremost members.
The next branch was established at Peterborough on the 28th April, 1887, mainly through the exertions of Mr. J. M. Long.
A small branch was also started in Victoria, but in 1888 had not been affiliated to the Canadian organisation.
In 1886, Lt.-Colonel Wm.
Hamilton Merritt, one of the officers of my regiment, came to me and endeavoured to enlist my sympathies in the new movement.
I discussed the whole subject fully with him.
He had hoped to get me to accept the presidency of the branch to be formed in Toronto.
I refused to take any part in the matter, feeling that Canada was getting along very well, but that she had only just expended nearly $150,000,000 in the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and that she required some years of steady development before she could undertake any further expenditures on a large scale for Imperial defence, for I saw this was the main object of the League in England.
I did not think the time had come, nor the necessity, for pressing this point, and that public opinion would not be in favour of any such movement.
It will be seen that Imperial Federation made very little progress for the first two or three years.
In 1885, 1886, and 1887, only three branches, and, with the exception of Halifax, very small and uninfluential ones, had been established in all Canada.
There was no branch in Toronto, the most Imperialistic and most loyal of all the cities of Canada, and up to the fall of 1887 the movement had made but little headway.
In the year 1887, however, a movement arose which changed the whole features of the case, which altered all the conditions, and made it necessary for all loyal men in Canada to consider seriously the future of their country.
This movement, known as Commercial Union will be dealt with in the next chapter.
This competition affected the great financial interests of New York, for the United States railroads were subject to regulations as to the long and the short haul, while the Canadian Pacific Railway was free from them, and thereby had a very great advantage in the struggle for business.
This direct present pecuniary interest, added to the belief that Canada was likely to prove a much greater factor on this continent than had ever been anticipated by the people of the United States, was the cause of the inception of the Commercial Union Movement, which attracted so much attention at the time, and has had such far-reaching influence on the affairs of the British Empire ever since.
The originator of this movement, Erastus Wiman of New York, was born at Churchville, near Toronto, and was educated and lived in Toronto for a number of years in his early life.
He was connected with the Press and for a time kept a small book shop on King Street.
He served a year in the Toronto City Council.
He became Toronto manager of R. G. Dun and Company's Commercial Agency in 1860, and afterwards went to New York and became manager of it there, and a member of the firm.
He was also president of the Great North Western Telegraph Company, which controlled almost all the telegraph lines in Canada.
He had not taken the oath of allegiance to the United States, and he was suited in every way to lead the insidious scheme which was started under the name of Commercial Union, but was intended to bring about peacefully the annexation of Canada to the United States.
The movement was planned and launched with remarkable skill.
Mr. Wiman, who was posing as a true-hearted Canadian, was, I believe, working for great financial interests in the States, headed by Jay Gould.
Of course, of this there is no proof, but only the deduction that can be drawn from a close study of all the information that can be had.
The first step was to establish the Canadian Club of New York, to be a home for welcoming Canadians visiting that city.
The next was still more ingenious.
A number of the most prominent Canadians, principally literary men, orators, &c., were invited to New York as guests of the Club, to address the members.
These visitors were treated with the warmest hospitality, and no indication given that Mr. Wiman had any ulterior motives.
About the same time, in 1886, Mr. Wiman gave some public baths to the citizens of Toronto, at a cost of about $6,000, as a proof of his warm feeling towards the city in which his early life had been spent.
After all this preparation he came to Canada in the spring of 1887, and aided by Goldwin Smith, Valancy Fuller, Henry W. Darling, President of the Toronto Board of Trade, and a few others, he proposed in the interests of Canada a scheme of Commercial Union between Canada and the United States which he claimed would be a great boon and lasting advantage to Canada.
During the whole summer of 1887 an active campaign was being conducted, meetings were held in many places, and addressed by Mr. Goldwin Smith, Mr. Wiman, Congressman Butterworth, of Ohio, and others.
The members of the Canadian Parliament were furnished with circulars, articles, and reports of speeches in profusion.
Mr. Wiman, as a member of the firm of Dun, Wiman and Company, had an influence over the business men of Canada that could hardly be overestimated.
It would have been a serious thing for any ordinary business man in any city, town, or village in Canada, if dependent upon his credit for the profitable conduct of his business, to incur the hostility of the mercantile agency, on whose reports his credit would largely depend.
The result was that at first the plausible speeches of its advocates, and the friendly assistance of some newspapers, caused the movement to acquire a considerable amount of success.
It was not thoroughly understood.
It had been inaugurated as in the direct interest of Canada by a friendly and successful Canadian, and was being discussed in a friendly way, and many good men at first supported the idea, not suspecting any evil, and not fearing that it might result in annexation.
I was away on a visit to England from the 19th May until the 21st August, 1887, and heard very little of what was going on, and not enough to understand the details or real facts of the scheme.
After my return to Canada I asked my brother, the late Lt.-Colonel Fred C. Denison, then a member of the House of Commons for West Toronto, what it all meant.
He was not at all favourably impressed.
He had been supplied with copies of the literature that was distributed, and I read it over, and we discussed the question very fully during some weeks.
We both agreed that it was a very dangerous movement, likely to bring about the annexation of Canada to the United States, and designed for that purpose by its originators, and we considered very carefully how it could be met and defeated.
I felt that, in view of the way in which it was being taken up at the time by the people, it would be hopeless to attack the scheme and endeavour to check its movement by standing in front of it and fighting it.
I was afraid we might be overrun and probably beaten.
I felt that the only way to defeat it was to get in front, and lead the movement in another direction.
My brother agreed with me in this, and we decided to take a course of action based on those lines.
The principal active workers at first were officers of my regiment and a few other personal friends, and small meetings were held in my brother's office to discuss the matter, and it was decided that the best policy was to advocate a Commercial Union of the British Empire as the alternative to the proposition of a Commercial Union with the United States, and that a scheme of Imperial Federation based upon a Commercial Union of the various parts of the Empire would be the best method of advocating our views.
By advocating Imperial Federation it enabled us to appeal to the old dream of the United Empire Loyalists of the Revolution.
It gave the opportunity of appealing to our history, to the sacrifices of our fathers, to all the traditions of race, and the ties of blood and kindred, to the sacrifices and the victories of the war of 1812, and to the national spirit of our people, to preserve our status as a part of the British Empire.
G. R. R. Cockburn, J. M. Clark, D'Alton McCarthy, John Beverley Robinson, Wm.
Hamilton Merritt, Lt.-Colonel Fred C. Denison, Casimir Dickson, Commander Law, John T. Small, D. R. Wilkie, John A. Worrell, Henry Wickham, and James L. Hughes were the moving spirits in organising the Toronto Branch of the Imperial Federation League, and it was accomplished during the last two or three months of 1887 and the beginning of 1888.
In October, 1887, Erastus Wiman sent a circular to the Members of the House of Commons, asking them for their views upon his scheme.
I must tell you that I am utterly opposed to it, as in my mind  Commercial Union simply means annexation, a result to be deplored by  every true Canadian, and unlikely to happen without the shedding of  a lot of Canadian blood.
We are now, despite what the advocates of  Commercial Union say, a happy, prosperous, and contented people.
I am  positive no pecuniary advantage would accrue to Canada from Commercial  Union, but even granting all that you say as to the increased  prosperity it would bring to us, I would still be opposed to it.
We do  not in Canada place so high a value upon the "Almighty Dollar" as do  the Yankees, and we hope always to be Canadians.
Why should we sever  our connection with the Mother Country, which has in the past done so  much for us, for the sake of throwing in our lot with a people who  produce more bank thieves and embezzlers than any other country in the  world; who care so little for the sanctity of the marriage tie that  one hundred divorces a day have been granted in one city?
To do so  would be national suicide.
No pecuniary advantage can ever outweigh  our national life, or our national honour.
The appeals made in favour  of Commercial Union are all addressed to the pocket, but I have  confidence in my fellow countrymen that they will place our national  honour and our independence above all pecuniary considerations.
A  man worthy of the name will not sell his own honour, or his wife's  or his daughter's, for money.
Such a proposal could not for a moment  be considered from a financial standpoint, and no people worthy of  the name would ever sacrifice their national honour for material  advantages.
There is no sentiment that produces such sacrifices as  national sentiment, and you gentlemen who advocate Commercial Union,  argue as if my countrymen would sell everything dear to them for  money.
You entirely misunderstand our people.
a heart beats there     Loyal to more than selfish minds can grasp;     Not gold our nation's wealth, or lavish ease,     Nor sordid aim her rod of destiny.
Canada hath ends beyond a life     Fed by loose license, luxury, and pelf.
She hath inherited through noble sires     Of ancient blood, and lineage straight and clean,     Great riches.
A renown unequalled yet;     A liberty hard won on many a field;     A country wide and large, and fair and full;     A loyalty as self-denying as a vow;     An honour high as heaven and pure as light;     A heroism that bleeds, but blenches not;     An industry of muscle true as steel;     A self-restraint that binds a world in bonds;     An honesty contented with its own.
Shall she sell these for gold?
"What can gold give     Better than she hath?--a nation's life     A nation's liberty, a nation's self-respect."
Brave words--my Denison--brave words and true!
Take thou this tribute from a patriot heart.
As thee our legislators ever be;     Men whose whole aim is for the nation's weal     And for safekeeping of her name intact.
On the 30th December, 1887, the Toronto Board of Trade gave a banquet in honour of the Rt.
Joseph Chamberlain.
It was a very large and influential gathering.
I then fired my first public shot against Commercial Union.
Colonel Otter was put down to respond to the toast of the Army, Navy, and Active Militia, but the Chairman in proposing the toast, added my name also, without having given me any intimation whatever that I would be called upon to speak.
I quote the report which appeared in the _World_ the next morning of my three minutes' speech:   As belonging to the active militia of the country, I am very glad  to be here to-night to do honour to so distinguished a statesman as  the Rt.
Joseph Chamberlain, because that gentleman, above all  gentlemen in the Empire, has shown that he places the interests of a  United Empire above all others (applause).
There is no part of the  British Empire where these words, "United Empire," convey a greater  meaning to the hearts of the people than to the people of Canada  (applause), and I am certain there is no part of the whole Empire  where the Rt.
Mr. Chamberlain is more heartily appreciated than  in Toronto, the capital of the Province of Ontario--a Province  which owes its origin to the desire on the part of men who, like Mr.  Chamberlain, desired a United Empire, and made great sacrifices for  it.
There is a subject upon which I wish to say a word or two before  I sit down, and that is Commercial Union.
And in the presence of Mr.  Chamberlain I wish to say that the active militia of this country  have all been sworn to be faithful, and bear true allegiance to her  Majesty, and they intend that Canada shall not be laid at the feet of  any foreign country (great applause).
I am a Canadian, born in this  city, and I hope to live and die a Canadian, to live and die in a  country where our people will govern their own affairs, where we will  be able to establish our own tariff, and where it will not be fixed  and established to suit a foreign people against our Mother Country.
I can assure Mr. Chamberlain that when I speak in behalf of the  volunteers of the country in this way, I am also voicing the feeling  of all the fighting men in this country.
My remarks were received with great applause, and created somewhat of a sensation, for it appeared that there had been an understanding that the subject of Commercial Union was not to be referred to, and all the speakers had been warned except myself.
I have had a suspicion since that I was called upon suddenly in the belief that I would speak out plainly.
The Toronto _World_ commenting on the dinner said:   The main result of Mr. Chamberlain's visit to Toronto and the speeches  made at the dinner on Friday night must be a heavy blow and a great  discouragement to the Commercial Unionists.
On Friday afternoon it  was stated to the reporters, on good authority, we believe, that the  management of the Board of Trade had arranged to exclude the much  disputed question of Commercial Union from among the subjects of the  speeches.
But as Burns wrote--      The best laid schemes of mice and men     Gang aft agley.
Colonel Denison's remarks so heavily charged with the electricity of  British connection, "brought down the house," and after that all other  subjects were lame and uninteresting to the company in comparison.
Our distinguished visitor soon made it evident that he thought it the  question of the day.
The event on Friday night, we repeat, must prove the worst blow that  the Commercial Unionists have got since they forced their "fad" before  the public.
After this we fancy there will be a stampede among them to  get out from a most unpleasant and ridiculous position.
As early as October, 1887, the late Thomas Macfarlane, one of the ablest and most active members of the Imperial Federation League, wrote to the journal of the League in England a strong article pointing out that Commercial Union would mean annexation, and advocating a uniform rate of duty on all foreign imports in every country of the Empire over and above the ordinary tariff in force then.
This was Mr. Hoffmeyer's suggestion at the Colonial Conference of 1884, one made mainly as a commercial measure which would encourage trade and give a tie of interest to the various parts of the Empire.
Mr. Macfarlane had supported this view from the first.
During November and December, 1887, the matter was being considered, and on the 22nd December a preliminary meeting was held in Shaftesbury Hall, and after speeches by D'Alton McCarthy, G. R. R. Cockburn and others, resolutions were passed in favour of forming a Toronto branch, and a number gave in their names for membership.
Mr. McNeill's magnificent speech at Paris on the 19th January, 1888, was a most eloquent appeal in favour of Imperial Federation, and was printed and widely circulated in Ontario.
He argued strongly in favour of discriminating tariffs around the Empire.
On the 1st February the Toronto branch was formally organised, with the Hon.
Hamilton Merritt as Secretary.
It was then arranged that the Annual General Meeting of the Imperial Federation League in Canada should be held on the afternoon of the 24th March, 1888, for the transaction of business, and that in the evening there should be a large public meeting to inaugurate the Toronto branch, and to bring it prominently before the public.
It will be remembered that with those who took the most active part in the organisation of the Toronto branch the moving idea was to agitate for a commercial union of the Empire.
There was nothing in the original constitution of the Imperial Federation League that would justify such a policy being advocated.
It was therefore necessary to amend or alter the constitution to that extent.
Consequently, at the Annual General Meeting our Secretary, Wm.
Hamilton Merritt, moved, and D. R. Wilkie seconded, the following resolution:   That the Imperial Federation League in Canada make it one of the  objects of their organisation to advocate a trade policy between Great  Britain and her Colonies by means of which a discrimination in the  exchange of natural and manufactured products will be made in favour  of one another, and against foreign nations; and that our friends in  Parliament are hereby called upon to move in support of the policy of  this resolution at the earliest possible moment.
This was unanimously carried.
In the evening the public meeting was held at the Association Hall, which was crowded to its limit.
Mr. Cockburn was in the chair.
I moved the first resolution, which was as follows:   Resolved, that this meeting hails with pleasure the establishment of a  branch of the Imperial Federation League in this city, and confidently  hopes that through its instrumentality the objects of the League may  be advanced, and the ties which bind Canada to the Motherland be  strengthened and maintained.
In moving this resolution I outlined my reasons for advocating the cause, and pointed out the necessity of doing something to counteract the scheme of Commercial Union with the United States, calling on the patriotic sons of Canada in that crisis in the affairs of the country "to rally round the old flag and frustrate the evil designs of traitors."
I stated that the Commercial Union movement was designed by traitors, that I wished "to be fair to those who believed that the movement would not destroy the national life and sentiment of Canada," but adhered to the position that the movement originated in treason.
"There was no use mincing words in the matter.
Commercial Union could only be carried out by severing the ties which bound the Canadian people to the Motherland.
Not only that, but it aimed at the destruction of the national life of the country, by subjecting the people to the power and dictation of a foreign country."
The report in the _Empire_ went on to say:   He desired to draw the attention of the audience to a few facts in the  history of the continent.
Canada was a country with a comparatively  small population, but an immense territory, rich in every department  of mine and forest, lying alongside a country of immense population  and great resources.
If that country was not an aggressive country  the difficulty would be minimised.
He held, however, that it was an  aggressive and grasping country.
They wanted Florida, and they took  it; Louisiana and Alaska they annexed; California and Mexico they  conquered; and Texas they stole.
They wanted half of the State of  Maine that belonged to Canada, and they swindled the Canadian people  out of it by means of a false map.
The war between the North and  South was as much for tariff as slavery.
It was only after three  years that the North decided to emancipate the slaves.
They conquered  the South and put them under their feet.
He asked them to remember  their treatment of the Canadian people in dealing with the question  of Imperial Federation.
In 1775 they attempted to conquer Canada, and  again in 1812, but they were beaten ignominiously both times.
They  left no stone unturned in 1812 to conquer Canada, and gave it up as a  hopeless task after a three years' effort.
The population of Ontario  at that time was only 100,000, as against their ten millions.
They  fomented discord which led to the Fenian Raid in 1866.
Those benighted  warriors came armed with United States muskets.
They had never evinced  a friendly feeling towards Canada.
They sent the British Minister  home during the Crimean War when they thought England had her hands  full.
They gave a reciprocity treaty to Canada a few years ago,  and allowed it to remain in force long enough to open up a volume of  trade between the two countries, and then they suddenly cut it off in  the hope that it would produce annexation.
The Commercial Union fad  had its birth in treason, he reiterated, and was designed in the hope  of inducing the people of Canada to believe in the fallacy that, by  tying themselves hand and foot to a foreign and hostile Power, they  would get richer by it.
They wanted to make Canadians believe that an  extended market would benefit them.
Their real desire, however, was  to make Canada a slaughter market for their goods, and by crippling  Canadian industries eventually drive the people of the Dominion into  such a condition that they would be glad to accept annexation as an  alternative of absolute ruin.
They had conquered and stolen States  in the South, and now they desired to betray Canada in the North.
The scheme of Imperial Federation was designed to build up Canada  and her industries, and absolutely to demolish the delusive theory  propounded by the authors of that nefarious scheme Commercial Union.
Unrestricted Reciprocity and Commercial Union were one and the same.
The prime object of Imperial Federation was to complete an arrangement  with the Mother Country, whereby our goods would be admitted free  with a discriminating tariff against the importations of all foreign  Powers.
Such an arrangement he believed would not only benefit the  agricultural community, but also the whole population of the Dominion.
It would consolidate the Empire, and give the Canadian people greater  influence amongst the nations of the world.
Mr. J. M. Clark seconded the resolution in an eloquent speech and it was carried.
Mr. Alex McNeill moved the next resolution.
He said he had felt a great deal of doubt coming down from Ottawa that day, but when he was face to face with such a glorious meeting all his doubts passed away like mists before the light of the sun.
The news of that meeting would be tidings of great joy all over the Empire, for it would proclaim in trumpet tones that the great British City of Toronto was up and doing in the glorious work of Imperial Federation.
The meeting was most enthusiastic and spirited.
At its conclusion Mr. D'Alton McCarthy invited about fifteen or twenty of the Committee and speakers to his house to supper.
I remember walking over with Mr. R. C. Weldon, whose speech had been very warmly received.
He was very much astonished at the enthusiasm and vigour of the audience.
He told me he had never seen such a meeting before, and asked how I could account for it.
I replied, "Toronto is the most loyal and imperialistic city in the Empire."
Four days after this meeting, on the 28th March, 1888, Mr. D'Alton McCarthy, President of the League in Canada, placed on the order paper at Ottawa the following important notice of motion:   That it would be in the best interests of the Dominion that such  changes should be sought for in the trade relations between the United  Kingdom and Canada as would give to Canada advantages in the markets  of the Mother Country not allowed to foreign States, Canada being  willing for such privileges to discriminate in her markets in favour  of Great Britain and Ireland, due regard being had to the policy  adopted in 1879 for the purpose of fostering the various interests and  industries of the Dominion, and to the financial necessities of the  Dominion.
This was the beginning of the great scheme of preferential tariffs around the Empire, which has since attracted so much attention throughout the British possessions.
Mr. McCarthy's resolution did not carry at that time; it was not intended that it should.
It was adjourned after some discussion.
It was a new idea in Canadian politics, and the members had not had time to study the question in all its bearings.
The _Imperial Federation Journal_, representing the League in England, was not favourable to the action of the Canadian branch, and advised the Canadians to approach the other Colonies, and not disturb the Mother Country with the proposal.
Within five years this cause of difference had, I believe, much to do with the disruption of the League in Great Britain.
Mr. McNeill's reference to the importance of Toronto's accession to the cause was well founded, for after that meeting the movement went on with increased impetus, and subsequent events proved the far-reaching effect upon the affairs of the Empire.
During the next three years a most vigorous campaign was carried on in Ontario.
Toronto became the headquarters of the League, a large branch was kept up, and efforts were made to educate the public mind and organise branches of the League in other places.
An organising committee was appointed, of which I was elected chairman.
The movement, which had been started in Montreal three years before, had languished, and it was not until the Commercial Union movement alarmed the people and proved the necessity for prompt action that the cause of Imperial Federation became a strong and effective influence upon the public opinion of Canada.
It will be of interest to trace this phase of the question and its development during the three or four years in which the great struggle took place.
Ralph Waldo Emerson, in conversation with William Allingham in November, 1872, said, "Americans will not take any definite step; they feel that Canada must come into the Confederation, and will of herself.
American party in Canada always at work."
--_Allingham's Diary_, p. 217 (Macmillan).
It will be remembered that I said that the United States "were an aggressive and grasping people."
"They wanted Florida and they took it, Louisiana and Alaska they acquired, California and Mexico they conquered, and Texas they stole."
I went on to say that "they had conquered and stolen States in the South, and now they desired to betray Canada in the North."
This speech was made on the 24th March, 1888.
I was criticised by some on the ground that my remarks were extreme in their character, and was caricatured and ridiculed in the comic papers.
Six months later I was vindicated in a remarkable manner.
Senator Sherman, at that time one of the foremost statesmen of the United States, and chairman of the Senate Committee of Foreign Affairs, made a very significant speech before the Senate on the 18th September, 1888.
He said:   And now, Mr. President, taking a broader view of the question, I  submit if the time has not come when the people of the United States  and Canada should take a broader view of their relations to each other  than has heretofore seemed practicable.
Our whole history since the  conquest of Canada by Great Britain in 1763 has been a continuous  warning that we cannot be at peace with each other except by political  as well as commercial union.
The fate of Canada should have followed  the fortunes of the Colonies in the American Revolution.
It would  have been better for all, for the Mother Country as well, if all this  continent north of Mexico had participated in the formation, and  shared in common the blessings and prosperity, of the American Union.
So evidently our fathers thought, for among the earliest military  movements by the Continental Congress was the expedition for the  occupation of Canada and the capture of the British forces in Montreal  and Quebec.
The story of the failure of the expedition--the heroism of  Arnold and Burr, the death of Montgomery, and the fearful sufferings  borne by the Continental forces in the march and retreat--is familiar  to every student of American history.
Without going into the details so familiar to the Senate, it is  sufficient to say that Spain held Florida, France held all west of the  Mississippi, Mexico held Texas west to the Pacific, and England held  Canada.
The United States held, subject to the Indian title, only the  region between the Mississippi and the Atlantic.
The statesmen of this  Government early discerned the fact that it was impossible that Spain,  France, and Mexico should hold the territory then held by them without  serious detriment to the interests and prosperity of the United  States, and without the danger that was always present of conflicts  with the European Powers maintaining Governments in contiguous  territory.
It was a wise policy and a necessity to acquire these vast  regions and add them to this country.
They were acquired and are now  held.
Precisely the same considerations apply to Canada, with greater force.
The commercial conditions have vastly changed within twenty-five  years.
Railroads have been built across the continent in our own  country and in Canada.
The seaboard is of such a character, and its  geographical situation is such on both oceans, that perfect freedom as  to transportation is absolutely essential, not only to the prosperity  of the two countries, but to the entire commerce of the world: and as  far as the interests of the two people are concerned, they are divided  by a mere imaginary line.
They live next-door neighbours to each  other, and there should be a perfect freedom of intercourse between  them.
A denial of that intercourse, or the withholding of it from them,  rests simply and wholly upon the accident that a European Power  one hundred years ago was able to hold that territory against us;  but her interest has practically passed away and Canada has become  an independent Government to all intents and purposes, as much so  as Texas was after she separated herself from Mexico.
So that all  the considerations that entered into the acquisition of Florida,  Louisiana, and the Pacific coast, and Texas, apply to Canada, greatly  strengthened by the changed condition of commercial relations and  matters of transportation.
These intensify, not only the propriety,  but the absolute necessity of both a commercial and a political union  between Canada and the United States.
The way to union with Canada is not by hostile legislation; not by  acts of retaliation, but by friendly overtures.
This union is one  of the events that must inevitably come in the future; it will come  by the logic of the situation, and no politician or combination of  politicians can prevent it.
The true policy of this Government is to  tender freedom in trade and intercourse, and to make this tender in  such a fraternal way that it shall be an overture to the Canadian  people to become a part of this Republic.
The settlement of the North-West Territory, the Louisiana and  Florida purchases, the annexation of Texas, and the acquisition from  Mexico are examples of the adaptation of our form of government for  expansion, to absorb and unite, to enrich and build up, to ingraft in  our body politic adjacent countries, and while strengthening the older  States, confer prosperity and development to the new States admitted  into this brotherhood of Republican States.
With a firm conviction that this consummation most devoutly to be  wished is within the womb of destiny, and believing that it is our  duty to hasten its coming, I am not willing, for one, to vote for any  measure not demanded by national honour that will tend to postpone the  good time coming, when the American flag will be the signal and sign  of the union of all the English-speaking peoples of the continent from  the Rio Grande to the Arctic Ocean.
I ask that the resolution be referred to the Committee on Foreign  Relations.
I drew attention to this speech in a letter to the Toronto _Globe_ on the 26th September, 1888.
After quoting a number of extracts from it, I went on to say,   "This man is honest and outspoken.
He is trying to entice us by kindly  methods to annexation, which would be the annihilation of Canada as a  nation; but does not his whole argument prove the absolute correctness  of the view I took of Commercial Union at the Imperial Federation  meeting, and does it not prove that his co-worker Wiman, being a  Canadian, was acting the part of a traitor, in trying to betray his  native country into a course which could only end in placing it  absolutely in the hands of a foreign and hostile Power?"
A few days later another incident occurred showing the active interest that was being taken in the annexation movement.
So  far have matters progressed that it is not at all unlikely that a  resolution will be reported for concurrent action of both Houses,  declaring it to be the duty of the President to open negotiations  with Great Britain, looking to a political union between the  English-speaking nations on this continent.
The condition attending the invitation of Canada is understood to be  that the United States would assume the entire public debt of the  Dominion, estimated at $300,000,000.
Commercial Union was urged as the basis of the proposed negotiation,  on the ground that while a large majority might be secured for it,  only a small minority favoured political union, but the sentiment of  the Committee was so strong in favour of proposing at first Political  Union, that it was impossible to contend with it.
An attempt was made by Mr. Wiman to withdraw this message, but it failed, and it was published in two or three papers.
The United States papers were for a year or two filled with articles discussing annexation, sometimes in friendly strains, sometimes in a most hostile spirit.
President Cleveland's retaliation proclamation following closely the refusal of the United States Senate to confirm a treaty which had been agreed upon between Great Britain and the United States, was a direct threat against Canada, issued to the people of the Republic at a time likely to influence the result of the approaching Presidential election.
On the 26th September, 1888, the Chicago _Tribune_ concluded a very aggressive article with these words:   There are two ways in which Canada can protect herself from all  possibility of a quarrel with this country about fish.
One of these  is by commercial union with the United States.
The other is political  union.
If she is not ready for either, then her safety lies in not  provoking the United States by unfair or unfriendly dealing, for when  the provocation comes, Uncle Sam will reach out and take her in, in  order to ensure quiet, and neither she nor her venerable old mother  can prevent it.
This paper about the same time had a cartoon depicting "The United States in 1900," showing Uncle Sam bestriding the whole North American continent.
The New York _World_, in December, 1888, also published a map of North America to show what the United States would look like after Canada came in, and depicted our country divided up into twenty-eight new States and territories, and named to suit the Yankee taste.
In connection with this map the _World_ published an interview with Senator Sherman, in which he advocated strenuously the annexation of Canada to the United States, saying that "the fisheries dispute and the question of the right of free transit of American goods over Canadian railroads are a type of the disputes that have vexed the two nations for a century, and will continue to disturb them as long as the present conditions exist.
To get rid of these questions we must get rid of the frontier."
In the descriptive article on the map everything that could help to excite the cupidity of the people of the United States was said and with great ability, and Professor Goldwin Smith was cited as declaring:   It is my avowed conviction that the union of the English-speaking  race upon this continent will some day come to pass.
For twenty years  I have watched the action of the social and economical forces which  are all, as it seems to me, drawing powerfully and steadily in that  direction.
The map and the articles accompanying it were evidently published to accustom the minds of the people of the United States to the idea of expansion and aggression:   What a majestic empire the accompanying map suggests; one unbroken  line from the Arctic Ocean to the Torrid Zone.
The United States  is here shown as embracing nearly the whole of the North American  continent.
Having conquered the Western wilderness the star of  Empire northward points its way.
There would be no more trouble  about fishing treaties or retaliation measures, and peace with all  nations would be assured, by making the United States absolute master  of the vast Western continent.
The Empire that this nation would  embrace under such circumstances is so vast in extent that none other  furnishes a parallel.
This is only an illustration of the feeling all over the United States at this period from 1888 to 1890.
The newspapers and magazines were filled with articles and cartoons all pointing in the same direction.
Mr. Whitney, a member of the United States Cabinet, even went so far as to say that four armies of 25,000 men each could easily conquer Canada, indicating that the question of attacking Canada had been thought of.
General Benjamin F. Butler, in the _North American Review_, one of their most respectable magazines, speaking of annexation, said, "Is not this the fate of Canada?
Peacefully, we hope; forcefully, if we must," and in the truculent spirit of a freebooter he suggested that the invading army should be paid by dividing up our land among them.
General J. H. Wilson, a prominent railway manager, presented a petition to the United States Senate in which he said:   The best and most thoughtful citizens were coming to look upon  the existence of Canada, and the allied British possessions in  North America, as a continuous and growing menace to our peace and  prosperity, and that they should be brought under the constitution and  laws of our country as soon as possible, peacefully if it can be so  arranged, but forcibly if it must.
Then came the McKinley Bill especially bearing upon the articles where Canada's trade could be most seriously injured.
It was believed that traitors in our own country assisted in arranging this part of the tariff so as to strike Canada as severely as possible.
As another instance of the unprincipled manner in which these conspirators carried on their work, the following Press dispatch was sent to some of the United States papers:   At a meeting called in Stimpson, Ontario, to hear a debate on  annexation _v._ independence or continued dependence, a vote taken  after the speakers had finished showed 418 for the annexation to 21  for the _status quo_.
It seems almost incredible, but this meeting is  a good indication of the rapid strides the annexation sentiment is  making among the Canadian people.
The Tories cannot keep Canada out of  the Union much longer.
As I have never been able to discover any place of that name in Ontario, and as there is no such post office in the official list, it is evident that the dispatch was a pure invention for the purpose of deceiving the people of the United States.
Another important indication of the feeling is shown in an article in the New York _Daily Commercial Bulletin_ in November, 1888, referring to certain political considerations as between Canada and the States.
It states:   What these are may be inferred from the recent utterances of prominent  American statesmen like Senator Sherman and Mr. Whitney, Secretary  of the Navy, just previous to the recent election, with reference  to which the _Bulletin_ has recently had something to say.
Both  are inimical to commercial union unless it be also complemented  by political union; or, to phrase it more plainly, they insist  that annexation of Canada to the United States can afford the only  effective guarantee of satisfactory relations between the two  countries, if these are to be permanent.
These prominent public men,  representing each of the great parties that have alternately the  administration of this Government in their hands, we are persuaded,  did not put forth these views at random, but that they voiced the  views of other political leaders, their associates, who are aiming at  making Canadian annexation the leading issue at the next Presidential  election.
As if speaking for the Republicans, Senator Sherman, as has  already been shown, thinks the country is now ready for the question;  while Secretary Whitney, as if speaking for the other political party,  is not less eager to bring the country face to face with it, even at  the risk of a war with England, though it is but justice to him to say  that he is of the opinion that the Mother Country, if really persuaded  that the Canadians themselves were in favour of separating from her,  would not fire a gun nor spend a pound sterling to prevent it.
The whole drift is unquestionably in that direction (political union),  and in the meantime we do not look for positive action on the part of  Congress, on either commercial reciprocity or the fisheries, at this  session or the next.
These questions, in all human probability, will  be purposely left open by the party managers in order to force the  greater issue, which, as it seems to me, none but a blind man can fail  to see is already looming up with unmistakable distinctness in the  future.
The _New York World_ in the early part of 1890 "instructed its correspondents in Montreal, Toronto, and Quebec to describe impartially the political situation in Canada in regard to annexation to the United States."
The report charges Premier Mercier with being "a firm believer in annexation as the ultimate destiny of the Dominion of Canada," but he "is too shrewd a politician to openly preach annexation to his fellow countrymen under existing circumstances."
The report also quotes the Toronto _Globe_ as saying that the Canadian people "find the Colonial yoke a galling one," and that "the time when Canadian patriotism was synonymous with loyalty to the British connection has long since gone by."
The concluding paragraph of the _World's_ article is the most suggestive and insolent:   Nobody who has studied the peculiar methods by which elections are  won in Canada will deny the fact, that five or six million dollars,  judiciously expended in this country, would secure the return to  Parliament of a majority pledged to the annexation of Canada to the  United States.
The leading men in this conspiracy in Canada were Edward Farrer, Solomon White, Elgin Myers, E. A. Macdonald, Goldwin Smith, and John Charlton, the two latter being the only men of any prominent status or position in the movement, and after a time Charlton left it.
These men were avowed annexationists, while there were a great many in favour of commercial union who did not believe that it would result in annexation, or did not care, and there were numbers who were ready to float with the stream, and quite willing to advocate annexation if they thought the movement was likely to succeed.
When the Continental Union Association was formed in 1892, Goldwin Smith accepted the Honorary Presidency in Canada, for the organisation had its principal strength in New York, where a large number of prominent and wealthy men joined its ranks, Francis Wayland Glen being the Secretary.
Glen became angry at the defection of some Liberal leaders after they obtained office, and gave the names of the organisers in a letter to the Ottawa _Evening Journal_ of the 13th September, 1904, as follows:   Charles A. Dana, Andrew Carnegie, John Jacob Astor, Ethan Allen,  Warner Miller, Edward Lauterbach, Wm.
C. Whitney, Orlando B. Potter,  Horace Porter, John Hay, Theodore Roosevelt, Elihu Root, Oswald  Ottendorfer, Cornelius N. Bliss, John D. Long, Jno.
B. Foraker, Knute  Nelson, Jacob Gallinger, Roswell P. Flower, Joseph Jno.
O'Donohue,  Chauncey M. Depew, John P. Jones, Wm.
Walter Phelps, General  Butterfield, General Henry W. Slocum, General James H. Wilson, General  Granville W. Dodge, Charles Francis Adams, Oliver Ames, Seth Low,  Bourke Cochrane, John C. McGuire, Dennis O'Brien, Charles L. Tiffany,  John Clafflin, Nathan Straus, and Samuel Spencer.
In the list we received in addition to these there were others, nearly 500 in all.
Afterwards, in 1893, I was able to get some further information as to the treasonable nature of the movement as far as the Canadian side of it was concerned.
The intention of those interested in the United States was to endeavour to extend the power of that country to the Arctic Ocean, as it had been extended to Mexico and the Pacific.
The Continental Union League in New York was in close connection with the Continental Union Association of Ontario.
Mr. Goldwin Smith, as I have said, accepted the position of Honorary President, John Morrison was the President, and T. M. White Secretary.
The headquarters were in Toronto.
We had information at the time that Mr. Goldwin Smith subscribed $500 to the funds, and that this was intended to be an annual subscription.
There were two members of our League with whom I was constantly conferring on the private matters connected with our work.
Upon them, more than on any others, did I depend for advice, for consultation, and for assistance, and I can never forget the obligations I am under to them.
We three accidentally saw an opportunity of getting some knowledge of the working of the Continental Union League in New York.
By great good fortune we were able to perfect arrangements by which one who was in the confidence of the movement in New York was induced to send us any information that could be obtained.
For a considerable time we were in receipt of most interesting information, much of which was verified by independent evidence.
We often heard from our agent beforehand of what was going to take place, and every time matters came to pass just as we had been forewarned.
In many instances we had independent corroborative evidence that the statements were reliable.
We were informed of a written agreement, signed by a Canadian Liberal leader, to have legislation carried to handicap the Canadian Pacific Railway if the Liberal party came into power.
Our agent even obtained knowledge of where and by whom it was signed, and who at the time had custody of it.
We received copies of many of Glen's letters to Mercier, Fairer, Bourke Cochrane, and others.
One letter to Colonel John Hay at Washington informed him that the New York League was working in conjunction with the Ontario League.
A letter to Farrer told him of a meeting held in November, 1893, in the New York _Sun_ office, at which Honore Mercier, John Morrison, Tarte, and Robidoux were present, that money was asked to aid the Liberals, but Glen objected.
This information we received some months after this meeting had been held.
Eleven years later, in the letter already referred to, which Glen in his anger wrote to the Ottawa _Journal_ of the 13th September, 1904, I find the following paragraph:   Upon the 4th November, 1893, Wilfrid Laurier held a meeting of his  friends in Montreal, and that meeting sent a deputation to New  York to ask funds of the National Continental Union League for the  elections, which it was supposed would take place in the spring of  1894.
Israel Tarte, Honore Mercier, J. E. Robidoux, Louis Joseph  Papineau and Mr. Langelier, and Sir Oliver Mowat was represented by  John Morison, of Toronto.
These gentlemen met Mr. Dana, Mr. Carnegie,  and myself in the office of _The Sun_ on November 6th.
Mr. Tarte  asked as a beginning for $50,000, with which to purchase _Le Monde_  newspaper, and Mr. Morison desired $50,000 to purchase a labour paper  in Toronto.
Mr. Carnegie asked Mr. Tarte if he was prepared to pledge  the Liberal party to advocate the independence of Canada as a prelude  to continental union.
He replied that if we furnished them with money for the elections they  would do so if they were successful in the elections.
Mr. Morison  agreed with Mr. Tarte.
Mr. Carnegie then asked Hon.
Honore Mercier if  he would contest the province of Quebec in favour of the independence  of Canada as a prelude to continental union.
He replied, Yes.
This statement cannot be taken as reliable.
Glen himself was not reliable, and it is not at all probable that Sir Wilfrid Laurier had anything to do with sending these men to New York, and yet some of them may have told Glen that he had, or Glen may have assumed it.
Certainly Sir Oliver Mowat never asked Mr. Morison to make any application of any kind.
I do not believe he would have entrusted him with any mission, and I am sure Sir Oliver Mowat was as much opposed to these intrigues as I was.
It is quite possible that Morison posed in New York as representing Sir Oliver Mowat, but it was an absurdity.
The letter of Glen, however, proves that there was some foundation for the information our agent sent to us.
In a letter to Mercier in February, 1894, Glen stated that John Charlton, an Ontario Liberal, had called on Dana the day before for money, and I have another letter signed by Francis W. Glen which corroborates this statement of our informant.
Mr. Goldwin Smith's name appeared often in the correspondence, so did Erastus Wiman's.
Myers is mentioned as going over to New York to see Dana.
Glen writes to Mercier on the 3rd April, 1894, to write to Farrer in reference to Goldwin Smith.
On the same day he wrote to Bourke Cochrane telling him that Goldwin Smith was anxious for a resolution in Congress.
We therefore invite the Canadian people to cast in their  lot with their own continent, and assure them that they shall have all  the continent can give them.
We will respect their freedom of action,  and welcome them when they desire it into an equal and honourable  union.
I do not know whether this was introduced into Congress or not.
We also had information of meetings at Carnegie's house and _The Sun_ office, and what took place at them.
All our information was conveyed to Sir John Thompson, and at a meeting in Halifax he made some reference to movements that were going on in the States, which apparently attracted attention.
Not long after this we heard from our informant that at a meeting where Carnegie, Dana, and Goldwin Smith were present, Goldwin Smith said they would have to be very careful, as he believed there was a leak somewhere.
Among other information we obtained was a copy of the subscriptions to the fund.
Some of the more important were Andrew Carnegie, $600; R. P. Flower, $500; Charles A. Dana, $460; J. J. Astor, $200; O.
B. Potter, $150; W. C. Whitney, $100, &c.  Outside and apart from all this information, I was shown a letter from Honore Mercier to Charles A. Dana, and a letter enclosing it to the President of the Continental Union Association of Ontario.
I was able to secure photographs of these letters.
I forwarded one copy of these photographs to Lord Salisbury, but kept copies from which the facsimiles here published are taken.
I asked him to see you without delay, and to tell you what took place.
As the matter he placed before me concerns chiefly the American side  of our common cause, I thought better to have your view first and be  guided by you.
General Kirwin seems to be a reliable man, as you stated in your  letter, and to be much devoted to our cause.
My trip in the East has been a success and will bring out a strong and  very important move in favour of Canadian Independence.
I will be in Chicago on the 22nd inst.
to take part in the French  Canadian Convention and hope to obtain there a good result.
Allow me to bring your attention to my state of poverty and to ask you  if our New York friends could not come to my rescue, in order that I  might continue the work, in providing me with at least my travelling  expenses.
I make that suggestion very reluctantly but by necessity.
I intend to leave for Chicago on Sunday, the 13th inst., and  stop at Detroit and Buffalo.
Its demands are moderate.
You know the sum which is in my hands.
How much should I send him?
Please return the letter with your answer.
[Illustration: facsimile of letter]  This letter of Mercier's is very significant.
I do not understand the allusion to General Kirwin.
His name was Michael Kirwin, and he is not to be confused with Capt.
Michael Kirwan who served in the North-West Rebellion.
I knew the latter well, he was an Irish gentleman.
The General Kirwin was a Fenian, and from what I heard of him at the time I gathered that he was somewhat of a soldier of fortune.
Whether Mercier was intriguing for a Fenian rising or for Fenian influence in the United States in favour of annexation I do not know, but the association with such a man had a sinister look, to my mind.
The letter, however, shows Mercier's strong support of Canadian Independence, and his desire to obtain money from foreign enemies of his country to enable him to carry out his intrigues.
The transmission of this letter to the President of the Continental Union Association of Ontario for advice as to how much money should be paid out to Mercier shows how closely the two organisations were working together.
The foregoing pages show clearly the object and aim of the Commercial Union Conspiracy, the widespread influence of the movement among the foremost men of the United States, the dangers Canada had to face, with the power of a great country active and unscrupulous against her, and embarrassed by the internal treachery of disloyal men in her own borders.
My main object in the following chapters will be to describe the efforts and exertions made to warn our people, and to frustrate the designs and intrigues of our enemies at home and abroad.
The vote was taken at half-past four on the morning of the 7th April after a discussion lasting for many days.
The resolution was defeated by a majority of 57 in a house of 181 members.
The Commons of Canada then sang "God Save the Queen."
The _Mail_ attacked me on the 26th April, 1888, on account of my statement that the originators of commercial union were traitors, and threatened that if I did not desist from acting in that way I should be removed from the position of police magistrate.
Replying the next day in a letter to the editor I repeated:   that Commercial Union originated in treason, and that it emanated  from a traitor in New York.
This view I still hold and will express  whenever and wherever I feel disposed.
I went on to say:   I do not look upon this question as a political or party question.
It  is one affecting our national life.
It is a foreign intrigue to betray  us into the hands of a foreign people, and it behoves every Canadian  who loves his country to do his utmost to save it from annihilation.
I did not ask for the position of police magistrate; it was offered  to me by cable when I was in England.
I accepted it at Mr. Mowat's  request.
I feel under no obligation whatever to the country for the  office.
I feel I am giving good service for every dollar I receive.
I did not want the office at the time I was appointed, and can live  without it whenever I choose to do so, and all the traitors in the  United States and Canada combined cannot make me cease to speak for  my country when occasion requires .
on questions affecting the  national life, I shall always try to be in the front rank of those who  stand up for Canada.
On the 7th May, 1888, the Toronto branch sent a deputation to Lord Lansdowne, Governor-General, to present a memorial praying his Excellency to invite the Australian Governments, and the Government of New Zealand to join the Canadian Government in a conference to devise means for the development of reciprocal trade and commerce.
_The Imperial Federation Journal_ published this memorial and Lord Lansdowne's reply, and spoke of the energy and _élan_ which the Canadian branches were displaying, and then added prophetically, "They have, if we mistake not, set a ball a-rolling that will be found ere long too big to be described in the half dozen lines of print that is all the great English newspapers have so far seen fit to devote to the subject."
The organisation of new branches of the League followed rapidly the successful meeting in Toronto.
On the 2nd April, 1888, a strong branch was formed at Brantford, Ontario.
On the 16th April another was formed at St. Thomas, another about the same time at Port Arthur, on the 4th May another at Orillia, while a very successful meeting of the Ottawa Branch was held on the 22nd April, to carry a resolution in favour of discriminating tariffs between the Colonies and the Mother Country.
On the 4th June there was a rousing meeting of the branch of the League at Halifax, Nova Scotia, at which a resolution was unanimously carried in favour of reciprocal trade between the colonies and Great Britain.
At this meeting the late Archbishop O'Brien, one of the ablest and most patriotic men that Canada has produced, made a most eloquent and powerful speech against commercial union or annexation, and, speaking of the men advocating these ideas, he said:   There are, however, others of this section less worthy of respect.
They are men who have not courage to face great national problems, but  think it wisdom to become the Cassandra of every noble undertaking.
These men have for leader and mouthpiece Goldwin Smith, the  peripatetic prophet of pessimism.
Because, forsooth, his own life  has been a dismal failure, because his overweening vanity was badly  injured in its collision with Canadian common sense, because we would  not take phrases void of sense for apophthegms of wisdom, he, the  fossilised enemy of local autonomy and the last defender of worn-out  bigotry, has put his feeble curse on Canadian nationality and assumed  the leadership of the gruesome crowd of Missis Gummidges, who see no  future for Canada but vassalage to the United States.
Let them, if  it so pleases, wring their hands in cowardly despair; but are we,  the descendants of mighty races, the inheritors of a vast patrimony,  the heirs of noble traditions, so poor in resources or so degenerate  as to know no form of action save the tears and handwringings of  dismal forebodings?
It is an insult, and should be resented as  such, to be told that annexation is our destiny.
The promoters of  Imperial Federation are called dreamers.
Well, their dream is at  least an ennobling one, one that appeals to all the noble sentiments  of manhood.
But what are we to say to the dreary prophets of evil,  the decriers of their country, the traitors of their magnificent  inheritance?
They are not dreamers: they are the dazed victims of a  hideous nightmare, to be kindly reasoned with when sincere, to be  remorselessly thrust aside when acting the demagogue.
The principle  of Canadian nationality has taken too firm a hold on our people  to permit them to merge their distinct life in that of a nation  whose institutions give no warrant of permanency, as they afford no  guarantee of real individual and religious liberty.
This extract from the speech of the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Halifax indicates clearly how the Canadian feeling was being aroused by the attempts upon the national life of Canada.
In the summer of this year the United States Senate refused to endorse the Fisheries Treaty which had been agreed upon by President Cleveland and the British authorities.
This was followed by a Retaliation proclamation, or at least by a message to Congress, asking for powers to retaliate upon Canada, by cancelling the bonding privileges which we have been using for very many years.
The Retaliation Act was passed after a most hostile discussion against Canada.
This threat was received by our people in the most unflinching spirit, and the matter was soon dropped by the United States Government.
In October, 1888, the Toronto _Globe_, evidently with the object of accustoming the minds of the Canadian people to the idea that the question of Annexation or Independence was a live issue, and one to be discussed and considered with as much freedom and propriety as tariff reform or temperance legislation or manhood suffrage, called for letters discussing the advantages or disadvantages of annexation or independence.
It was the same scheme that Goldwin Smith had endeavoured to work in the National Club.
On the 6th October I wrote a letter to the _Globe_ on the condition and prospects of Canada, and said:   Events are crowding upon us faster than we are aware.
Let us look back  over the past few months.
First came the Commercial Union movement,  apparently originated by a Canadian in the interests of Canada, but  which is now shown to have been a Yankee plot worked by a renegade  with the object of producing annexation.
Then came the repudiation  of the Fisheries Treaty by the Republican party, followed by the  Retaliation proclamation of the Democratic President; then came the  almost unanimous passage of the Retaliation Act in the United States  House of Representatives after a long succession of speeches by  members of both political parties violently abusive and unreasonably  hostile to Canada.
Then came the speech of Senator Sherman exposing  the hostile policy of a hundred years.
Then the discussion of  negotiations for annexation in the Committee of Foreign Relations, and  to-day Senator Sherman's interview, in which he says, "Political union  is necessary or war is inevitable."
At this moment the Presidential  election is being fought out on the question as to which party is  most hostile to England and Canada, and unless a marked change comes  over the people of the United States, it will not be many years  before we shall be fighting for our existence as a free people on this  continent.
Senator Sherman's last warning is straight to the point,  and cannot be overlooked or misunderstood.
I then went on to urge that we must forget all party differences, that we should unite in the face of the common danger, that a firm and united front might save us all the horrors of war, pointing out that "at the Trent affair if there had been treason in Canada, or the least sign of division in our ranks, we would have had war."
A number of letters in favour of annexation appeared in the _Globe_, and I became much alarmed, for the writers signed their names.
I felt that if the discussion went on unchecked it would in time have a certain effect upon the wobblers and the unreliable.
I had studied carefully the American Revolution, and was of the opinion that the whole success of that movement was due to the fact that the loyal men, and the law-abiding men, did nothing themselves, but relied upon the constituted authorities to check a movement that in the end robbed them of their property, deprived them of all their civil rights, and drove them penniless into exile.
I felt that as far as I was concerned I would leave no stone unturned to prevent such a fate befalling Canada through supineness or indifference.
At the annual dinner of the Caledonian Society of Toronto, on the 30th October, 1888, I responded to the toast of "The Army, Navy, and Volunteers."
The _Empire_ of the 31st October reported my speech as follows:   Colonel Denison launched forth a few hundred words which made the  Scots fairly jump with enthusiasm, He referred in the first place  to the achievements of Scotchmen in the British Army, and then spoke  about the Canadian Volunteers.
Canada at this moment, he said, is  passing through a very critical crisis in her history.
She will be  called upon to preserve her national life within the next three or  four years.
(Someone ejaculated "Oh!
It's all very well to say  "Oh!
said the Colonel.
I tell you things are crowding upon us  very fast.
Within the past two months we have seen one thing after  another showing a most bitter and hostile feeling towards this country  on the part of the United States.
Only this very evening came a  telegram from Washington, saying that Cleveland is going to issue his  retaliation proclamation immediately.
Let him do it.
I have  every faith in Canada.
We have got everything on this northern half  of this continent to make this a great country.
We have the country  and the people, and we can hold our own.
All that is necessary is for  us to be true to ourselves.
Then let us have confidence  in ourselves and in our future.
I am sorry to see that a few have  not sufficient confidence in our future.
I hope our volunteers will  mark these traitors in this country, and put them in the rear when  trouble comes.
I do not like to see letters in our papers advocating  annexation.
It is nothing but rank treason.
There is one  thing about it though, gentlemen, when these men come out, and put  their names to annexation papers, they can be marked.
We can put "ear  marks" on them, and when trouble comes we will know who the traitors  are.
(Ringing cheers.)
And I went on to say we were putting their names in a list.
The _Globe_ was evidently much put out at my action, and not daring openly to take the opposite view, relieved its feelings in a long article heaping ridicule upon me and upon the Rev.
Mr. Milligan, who had spoken sympathetically with me at the same dinner, and intimating that I was anxious for war with the United States.
I wrote in reply to this:   I believe the United States to be very hostile to Canada; I believe  they always have been.
I believe they will endeavour to destroy our  national life by force or fraud whenever they can, with the object  of absorbing us.
This has been my view for years, and I feel that  the history of the past is strong evidence of the correctness of my  opinion, if the events of the last two months are not absolute proof  of it.
I have always warned my fellow-countrymen of this danger.
I have  always striven to encourage a healthy Canadian national spirit, a  confidence in ourselves and in our future.
I have endeavoured to give  courage to the faint-hearted and the timid, and have always urged that  Canadians of all classes should stand shoulder to shoulder ready to  make any and every sacrifice for the State.
I have felt that doubts  and misgivings, the preaching and talking of annexation, were of  all things the most likely to induce the Yankees to attack us.
In  1812, the belief that we were divided, that the traitors were in the  majority among us, and that we were ripe for annexation, had much to  do with bringing on a bloody and severe war.
The unanimity and courage  displayed by our people at the Trent affair, the bold and unbroken  front then shown by the Canadians saved us from war at that time.
To-day every word that is said in Canada in favour of annexation, or  that shows a want of confidence in ourselves, is being vigorously used  in the United States to create a widespread belief in that country  that we are ripe for annexation.
This dangerous mistake will pave the  way to war, and this is why I so strongly resent a line of action that  is so fraught with danger to our country.
Talk of my wanting war!
The idea is absurd.
It is the last thing I  want.
I hold that we have a free Government, that we have the fullest  political, religious, and personal liberty.
Our country is one of the  most prosperous, if not the most prosperous, country in the world,  and we have every hope of a great national future.
If we had war  it would cost the lives of thousands of our best.
It would destroy  our property, ruin our business interests, throw back our country  twenty years in progress, burden us with an enormous debt, and if  completely victorious we could not be freer, or have greater liberty  or advantages, than we have to-day.
We have no reason to go to war,  unless we are driven to defend and preserve all we hold dear.
No one  appreciates this better than I do, and on that account all my efforts  have been in the direction of preserving peace.
If war comes you will probably be still carrying on the newspaper  business on King Street, your annexation correspondents will (if at  large) still be spreading fears and misgivings in the rear, if not  traitorously aiding the enemy, but I will have to be on the outpost  line, exposed to all the hardships and trials of war.
I know enough  of war to hope that the Almighty may give us peace in our time, but  rather than my country should be lost, I hope when the day of trial  comes that God may give me courage to make any and every sacrifice in  the interests of my native land.
I have been abused and attacked, threatened and ridiculed by Canadians  for speaking out for Canada, but while I live nothing shall prevent me  from doing what I believe to be the duty of every true Canadian.
One member of the Ontario Government met me on the street about this time, and took me to task for speaking so strongly on the question of Commercial Union and Unrestricted Reciprocity.
I gave him an emphatic reply that I would follow my own course in the matter.
Another prominent gentleman, since a Senator, and now a preferential tariff supporter, also spoke to me on the street, and said, "Certainly people should be allowed to discuss annexation or independence as they liked."
I denied this vehemently, and declared they could not have either without fighting, and I told him plainly that if he meant to secure either he had better hang me on a lamp-post, or otherwise, if it became a live issue, I would hang him.
I had made up my mind that if there was to be any of the work that the "Sons of Liberty" resorted to in the United States before the Revolution, we of the loyal party would follow their example and do it ourselves.
Sir Oliver Mowat, then Premier and Attorney-General, once spoke to me, advising me not to be so violent in my language.
My reply was that if the matter became dangerous I would resign my Police Magistracy one day, and he would find me leading a mob the next.
Sir Oliver Mowat was a thorough loyalist, and at heart I think he fully sympathised with me.
Early in November, 1888, there was a large Convention of Dentists held in Syracuse, New York State, which Dr. W. George Beers, of Montreal, attended.
At the banquet a toast was proposed, "Professional Annexation."
Beers replied in an eloquent, loyal, and manly speech, which voiced the Canadian feeling.
It was copied into many Canadian papers, and printed in pamphlet form and circulated broadcast throughout the country.
He told them: "Just as you had and have your croakers and cowards we have ours, but Canada is not for sale.
Annexation as a serious subject has received its doom, and in spite of the intoxication of senatorial conceit on the one side, and the croaking of malcontents and tramps on the other, Canada is loyal to the Mother Country from whose stout old loins both of us sprang."
And after describing the extent and resources of the British Empire, he said: "Sharers in such a realm, heirs to such vast and varied privileges, Canadians are not for sale."
During December, 1888, I spoke at a large meeting at Ingersoll on the 6th with Mr. J. M. Clark, on the 11th at Lindsay with Mr. James L. Hughes, and on the 20th at a meeting of the Toronto League.
In 1889 the work went on very vigorously.
Dr. George R. Parkin, one of the most eloquent and able of our members, who had been lecturing in England on behalf of the parent League, made a tour through Canada, and the Imperial Federation League arranged a series of meetings which he addressed with great eloquence and power.
He was then on the way to Australia, where his energy and enthusiasm helped on the spirit of Imperialism among the people of that colony and New Zealand, and gave the movement an impetus there which has not been lost.
This was helped by some speeches delivered in Australia in 1888, by Principal George M. Grant, the greatest of our members, one who never lost an opportunity of doing all he could for the cause.
It was an interesting fact that at one of Dr. Parkin's meetings at St. Thomas he was accompanied by Mr. E. E. Sheppard, who, it will be remembered, was one of the early advocates of Independence, and who had flown an Independence flag over his office in 1884.
Mr. Sheppard had been won over by the arguments of our League to advocate Imperial Federation as a practical means of becoming independent, and had become a member of our Committee and a very powerful advocate of our cause.
In Canada the League was very active this year.
On the 11th January, 1889, Mr. D'Alton McCarthy and I addressed a large and enthusiastic meeting at Peterboro.
On the 17th January I attended a Sons of England Banquet at St. Thomas, organised as a demonstration against Annexation and in favour of Imperial Unity, where I responded to the principal toast, and made a strong appeal against Commercial Union and in favour of Imperial Consolidation.
On the 9th February, A. J. Cattanach, Commander Law, J. T. Small and I went to Hamilton in Imperial Federation interests.
On the 18th February, Dr. Parkin spoke at St. Thomas.
On the 29th March, 1889, J. Castell Hopkins and I addressed a large meeting at Woodstock.
I spoke at the St. George's Society Banquet, Toronto, 23rd April.
On the 11th May, there was a large meeting at Hamilton addressed by Principal George M. Grant.
The Annual Meeting of the League took place at Hamilton the same day, and the early difficulties of the movement are well evidenced by the fact that at the Annual Meeting of the League only eleven representatives were present, viz.
Secretaries; Commander Law, Secretary Toronto Branch; D. T. Symons, Lt.-Colonel George T. Denison, J. T. Small, and Senator McInnes.
On the 21st May, Principal Grant delivered an address in Toronto, and another on the 16th August at Chatauqua, near Niagara-on-the-Lake, both powerful appeals in support of the cause.
The Commercial Unionists made violent attacks upon the League, ridiculing it and its objects, and caricatures were often published making light of our efforts, while many Liberal newspapers, led by the _Globe_, attacked us at every available opportunity.
The Commercial Union movement was as active and dangerous as ever, and the contest was carried on with great vigour all the year.
On the 6th February, 1890, I wrote to Sir John Macdonald telling him that the next election would be fought on the straight issue of loyalty.
At that time he hardly agreed with me, but before the year was out my forecast was verified.
On the 13th January, 1890, I addressed a dinner of the Sons of England.
On the 25th of the same month I had a letter in the _Globe_ pointing out the dangers of the belief obtaining ground that we were divided.
I knew that Mr. Mulock proposed moving a resolution in the House of Commons to show how united our people were on the question of loyalty to the Empire, and, to aid him, went on to say:   These conspirators are working now every day to pave the way for  trouble.
The public mind of the United States is being educated, and  those in Canada working for them and with them, some consciously,  some unconsciously, are sowing seed of which we will reap the bitter  harvest.
The Canadians advocating Independence are of two classes, one  a class loyal to Canada above all, the other using Independence as a  cloak, knowing that Independence just now, while making us no freer,  would deprive us of the backing of the Empire, and change our present  practical independence, either to an absolute dependence on the United  States or to the necessity of a desperate struggle with them.
Mr. Mulock will do good service if he succeeds, as I suppose he  will, in getting a unanimous vote of our Parliament in favour of  the existing constitution of our country.
It will show that we are  not a downtrodden people, waiting for our neighbours to aid us in  throwing off a galling yoke, and will tend to counteract the plots of  those conspirators who are intriguing for our conquest and national  extinction.
We must show them that we are a united people on national questions.
It is our only safeguard.
If we are to be weakened by internal  dissensions in the face of foreign aggression, God help our country.
We have learned with feelings of entire disapproval that various  public statements have been made, calling in question the loyalty  of the people of Canada to the political union now happily existing  between this Dominion and the British Empire, and representing it as  the desire of the people of Canada to sever such connection.
We desire, therefore, to assure Your Majesty that such statements are  wholly incorrect representations of the sentiments and aspirations  of the people of Canada, who are among Your Majesty's most loyal  subjects, devotedly attached to the political union existing between  Canada and the Mother Country, and earnestly desire its continuance.
We feel assured that Your Majesty will not allow any such statement,  emanating from any source whatever, to lessen Your Majesty's  confidence in the loyalty of your Canadian subjects to Your Majesty's  person and Government, and will accept our assurances of the  contentment of Your Majesty's Canadian subjects with the political  connection between Canada and the rest of the British Empire, and of  their fixed resolve to aid in maintaining the same.
We pray that the blessings of Your Majesty's reign may, for your  people's sake, be long continued.
Mr. Mulock's speech clearly explains the reasons for his action.
He said:   We are all observers of current events, we are all readers of the  literature of the day, and we have had the opportunity of observing  the trend of the American Press during the last few months.
In that  Press you find a doctrine set forth as if it were the expression of  one mind, but appearing in the whole of the Press of the United States  and being in that way spread far and wide.
You find it asserted there  that the political institutions in Canada are broken down; that we  are a people divided against ourselves or amongst ourselves; that  we are torn apart by internal dissensions; that race is set against  race, creed against creed, Province against Province, and the Dominion  against the Empire; and that this has created a feeling in favour of  independence or annexation which is now only awaiting the opportunity  to take practical form and shape.
These statements have, no doubt,  already done injury to our country.
A surplus population does not  seek countries which are supposed to be bordering on revolution.
Capital does not seek investment in countries which are supposed not  to be blessed with stable government.
Therefore, for the information  of the outside world, for the information of those who have not had  the advantage of being born or becoming Canadian citizens, for their  advantage and for our own advantage ultimately, I have asked the House  to adopt this resolution.
To give further colour to these statements,  we find that the United States Congress appointed a Committee of the  Senate, ostensibly to inquire into the relations of Canada with the  United States; but if anyone investigated the proceedings of that  Committee, he would find that apparently the principal anxiety of the  Commission is to discover satisfactory evidence that this country is  in a frame of mind to be annexed to the United States.
I know of no  better way of meeting their curiosity on that subject, and at the  same time of settling this question, than for the people of Canada,  through their representatives here assembled, to make an authoritative  deliverance upon the subject.
Such a deliverance will go far, I  believe, to settle the question in the minds of the people of the old  lands, those of England and of continental Europe, and then I hope  it will result in setting once more flowing towards our shores the  surplus capital and the surplus population of those old lands which  are so much wanted for the development of the resources of this vast  Dominion.
I make this statement in no feeling of unfriendliness to the  United States.
We cannot blame them for casting longing eyes towards  this favoured land, but we can only attribute that to Canada's worth,  and, therefore, to that extent we can appreciate their advances.
But  that the American people seriously believe that Canada, a land so full  of promise, is now prepared, in her very infancy, to commit political  suicide, I cannot for a moment believe.
Do the American people  believe that this young country, with her illimitable resources,  with a population representing the finest strains of human blood,  with political institutions based upon a model that has stood the  strain for ages, and has ever become stronger--do they believe that  this country, possessing within her own limits all the essentials  for enduring national greatness, is now prepared to abandon the work  of the Confederation fathers, and pull out from the Confederation  edifice the cement of British connection which holds the various parts  of the edifice together?
Do they, I say, believe that the people of  Canada are prepared in that way to disappear from the nations of the  earth, amidst the universal contempt of the world?
No, Mr. Speaker,  the American people are too intelligent to believe any such a thing.
They have been trying to make themselves believe it, but they cannot  do it.
But whether they believe it or not--no matter who believes it  outside of Canada--I venture to say the Canadian people do not believe  it; and whatever be the destiny of Canada, I trust that such as I have  indicated is not to be her destiny.
The motion was carried by a vote of 161 yeas and no nays.
This action of the House of Commons was of the greatest possible good, and gave great encouragement to our League.
By this time the meetings of the Executive Committee of the Imperial Federation League were generally held in my office, at the old Police Court.
I often occupied the chair in the absence of Mr. D'Alton McCarthy, and later of Sir Leonard Tilley, who succeeded him as President.
At a meeting held on the 17th February, 1890, Mr. Henry J. Wickham read a letter which he had received from a friend in the United States, mentioning the custom of flying the Stars and Stripes over the schools in that country, and suggesting that a like custom might be advantageous in Canada.
The idea was seized on at once, and it was decided to organise a representative deputation with a view to waiting on the Minister of Education, and getting him to make such a regulation that the national flag would be used in all public schools in Ontario, and hoisted on certain days of the year to commemorate events of national importance.
The details of the matter were left in the hands of Mr. H. J. Wickham and myself.
Mr. Wickham acted as secretary, and very soon we had organised a very influential and powerful deputation of representative men to wait upon the Hon.
G. W. Ross and to ask for Government recognition and authority for the movement.
On the 21st February, 1890, our deputation was received by the Minister of Education, and the objects we desired were explained to the Minister by Mr. Wickham, Mr. Somers (Chairman of the Public School Board), by myself as chairman of the deputation, and we were supported by Mayor Clarke, J. M. Clark and others.
Mr. Ross said that "it was needless to say that he sympathised deeply with the deputation in their request."
He said also that "he considered the display of the national emblem would be a fitting exhibition representing externally what was being done inside the schools.
He would have no objection to make such a regulation, if it was not easy enough now, and legal if it was not so now, to display the national emblem in some such way as to impress upon the children the fact that we are a country and have a flag and a place in it."
This was most satisfactory to us, and the movement soon became general, and now in several Provinces the practice of displaying the flag is followed.
On the same night, the 21st February, I attended the annual dinner of the Sergeants' Mess of the Queen's Own Rifles, all of whom were Imperial Federationists.
I found there, for the first time at a public dinner to my knowledge, as one of the principal toasts, "Imperial Federation," to which I responded.
Since then, at almost all public dinners in Canada, some patriotic toast of that kind has appeared on the programme--"The United Empire," "Canada," "Canada and the Empire" "Our Country," and many variations of the idea.
On the 4th March, J. M. Clark and I went to Barrie and addressed a large meeting in the interests of Imperial Federation, and received a hearty support.
Our Committee about this time thought it would be well to issue a kind of manifesto that would explain our objects, and put forth the arguments in favour of our views and could be used as a kind of campaign literature to be distributed freely throughout the country.
It was therefore arranged that a meeting should be held for the purpose of organising a branch of the League at Guelph, and that I should make a speech there that could be printed in separate form for general circulation.
Mr. Creighton, of the _Empire_, agreed to send a reporter to take a shorthand report which was to be published in that paper.
Mr. Alexander McNeill went to the meeting with me and made an excellent speech, one of many great efforts made by him for the cause.
The meeting was held on the 28th March, 1890, and afterwards fully reported in the _Empire_.
The meeting was large, the hall being filled, and was as unanimous and enthusiastic as the warmest advocate of Imperial Federation could have wished.
The report of this meeting was reprinted and circulated in great numbers throughout the country.
The following day Dr. W. George Beers delivered an eloquent and powerful lecture in Toronto in the interests of our cause, which was well received.
This adoption of the main point in the policy of the Canadian Branch of the League was very gratifying to us.
The Annual Meeting of the League in Canada took place on the 30th January, 1890, and there was considerable discussion on the question of preferential or discriminating tariffs around the Empire, although no formal resolution was carried, as direct action at that time was thought to be premature.
I moved a resolution: "That this League wishes to urge on the Government the importance of taking immediate steps to secure a universal rate of penny postage for the Empire."
This was seconded by Mr. McNeill, and carried.
A resolution was also carried against the German-Belgian Treaties which prevented preferential tariffs within the Empire.
Lt.-Col. W. Hamilton Merritt suggested that the League should send its organisers to England, as it was there the missionary work would have to be done.
Mr. McGoun supported this view, saying that "the policy of the Canadian League should be to send delegates to England to promote the gospel of commercial unity of the Empire."
It will be seen that at this early period of the movement the Canadian Branch of the League felt that the real work would have to be done in England.
We had discovered that there were clauses in two treaties with Germany and Belgium which positively forbade any special advantages in trade being given by Great Britain to any of her colonies, or by the colonies in favour of Great Britain or each other, that should not be given to Germany and Belgium.
This as a necessary consequence would take in all nations entitled to the favoured nation clause.
It was essential, as the very first step towards our policy being adopted, that these two treaties made in 1862 and 1865 should be denounced.
The earliest period that either of them could be denounced was on the 1st July, 1892, provided that a year's notice had been given before the 1st July, 1891, in order to secure that result.
After full discussion in our Executive Committee, I agreed to go to England with two objects in view, first to endeavour to prepare the way for the denunciation of the treaties, and, secondly, to urge the policy of preferential tariffs around the Empire.
A special resolution was adopted to authorise me to represent the Canadian Branch of the League while in England.
I arrived at Liverpool on the 27th April, 1890, and found a message requesting me to speak at a meeting at the People's Palace, Whitechapel, the next evening.
This meeting was called by the League in order that Dr. George Parkin might deliver an address on Imperial Federation.
The Duke of Cambridge was in the chair, and Lord Rosebery, Sir John Colomb, and I were the other speakers.
I was requested to say nothing about preferential tariffs, and consequently was obliged to refrain.
On the 13th May I happened to be at a meeting of the Royal Colonial Institute.
Col. Owen read a paper on the military forces of the colonies.
In the discussion which ensued Sir Charles Dilke, after complimenting other colonies, viz.
: Australia, New Zealand, and Cape Colony, then proceeded to comment adversely on Canada.
On the 19th May I addressed a meeting at the Mansion House, under the auspices of the London Branch of the Imperial Federation League, in favour of Australian Federation, and once more I was requested not to touch on the question of preferential tariffs.
On the 15th May I had attended the meeting of the Executive Committee of the League, and with some difficulty and considerable persistence had secured the insertion of the following clauses in the draft Annual Report:   10.
As anticipated in last year's Report, a strong feeling continues  to exist in Canada against the continuance in commercial treaties  with foreign countries of clauses preventing the different portions  of the Empire from making such internal fiscal arrangements between  themselves as they may think proper.
The League in Canada at its  Annual Meeting, held in January last, passed a resolution condemning  such stipulations.
Most of the treaties obnoxious to this view  terminate in 1892, and it is expected that strong efforts will be made  by the League in Canada to obtain the abrogation of such clauses where  they exist, and the provision under all treaties that the favoured  nation clause shall not have the effect of extending to foreign  countries the advantage of any preferential arrangement between  different parts of the Empire.
Any action in this direction taken by  the Dominion Government will have the hearty support of the Council.
The 13th clause of the Report contained a copy of Mr. Mulock's loyal address to the Queen from the Dominion House of Commons.
The 14th clause was as follows:   The significance of this action of the Dominion Parliament cannot be  overrated, and the League in Canada is to be congratulated upon this  most satisfactory outcome of its steady and persevering work during  the past three years.
When the Council Meeting was held on the 19th May to adopt the Report for presentation to the Annual Meeting, clause after clause was read and passed without question, until the 10th clause quoted above was reached, when at once an elderly gentleman rose and objected strongly to it, and moved to have it struck out.
He made a speech strongly Free Trade in its tenor, and urged that nothing should be done to aid or assist in any preferential arrangements.
Seeing at once that this reference to their favourite fetish appealed to the sympathies and prejudices of those present, I was sure that if not stopped other speakers would get up and endorse the view.
I jumped up at once as he sat down, and made a short speech, saying, I did not know when I had heard a more illogical and inconsistent speech, that I gathered from his remarks that the gentleman was a Free Trader, that his whole speech showed that he was in favour of freedom of trade, and yet at the same time he wished to maintain treaties that were a restriction upon trade; that if we in Canada wished to give preferences to British goods, or lower our duties in her favour, or if we wished to have free trade with Great Britain, these treaties would forbid us doing so, unless Germany and Belgium and all other countries were included; that I felt Canada would give favours to Great Britain, but would positively refuse to give them to Germany, and could anything be more inconsistent than for a man declaring himself a Free Trader on principle, and yet refusing to help us in Canada who wished to move in the direction of freer trade with the Mother Country, and I begged of him to withdraw his opposition?
This he did, and my clause was passed.
I found out afterwards that my opponent was Sir Wm.
Years afterwards when Canada gave the preference to Great Britain in 1897, and the treaties were denounced, the Cobden Club gave to Sir Wilfrid Laurier the Cobden gold medal.
The Annual Meeting of the Imperial Federation League was held three days later, on the 22nd May.
I was announced in the cards calling the meeting as one of the principal speakers, and as the representative of the League in Canada, and was to second the adoption of the Annual Report.
The day before the meeting, when in the offices of the League, a number of the Committee and the Secretary were present, I once more said that I wished to advocate preferential tariffs around the Empire.
It will be remembered that this was one of the two points that I was commissioned to urge upon the parent League.
I had been restrained at the People's Palace and at the Mansion House, but being a member of the League, a Member of the Council, and of the Executive Committee, and representing the League in Canada by special resolution, I made up my mind to carry out my instructions.
The moment I suggested the idea it was at once objected to, everyone present said it would be impossible.
I was persistent, and said, "Gentlemen, I have been stopped twice already, but at the Annual Meeting I certainly have the right to speak."
They said that Lord Rosebery would be annoyed.
I said, "What difference does that make; the more reason he should know how we feel in Canada; there was no use in my coming from Canada, learning Lord Rosebery's views, and then repeating them.
I thought he could give his own views better himself."
They then said "that it would be unpleasant for me, that the meeting would express disapproval."
I said, "The more reason they should hear my views, and I do not care what they do if they do not throw me out of an upstairs window," finally saying, "Gentlemen, if I cannot give the message I have undertaken to deliver I shall not speak at all, and will report the whole circumstances to the League in Canada, and let them know that we are not allowed to express our views."
This they would not hear of, and agreed that I could say what I liked.
Lord Rosebery, who presided, made an excellent speech; among other things he said:   You will look in vain in the report for any scheme of Imperial  Federation.
Those of our critics who say, "Tell me what Imperial  Federation is, and I will tell you what I think about it," will  find no scheme to criticise or discuss in any corner of our Annual  Report.
If there were any such scheme, I should not be here to move  it, because I do not believe that it is on the report of any private  society that such a scheme will ever be realised.
But I will say that  as regards the alternative name which Mr. Parkin--and here I cannot  help stating from the Presidential Chair the deep obligations under  which we lie to Mr. Parkin--has given to Imperial Federation, namely,  that of National Unity, that in some respects it is a preferable term.
But if I might sum up our purpose in a sentence, it would be that we  seek to base our Empire upon a co-operative principle.
At present the  Empire is carried on, it is administered successfully owing to the  energies of the governing race which rules it, but in a haphazard and  inconsequential manner; but each day this society has seen pass over  its head has shown the way to a better state of things.
Lord Rosebery's idea of a "co-operative principle" is not very far removed from the idea of a "Kriegsverein and a Zollverein."
In seconding the adoption of the Report I pointed out the many difficulties we had to face in Canada through the action of the United States, and concluded my speech in the following words:   Now with reference to a scheme of Imperial Federation, I quite agree  with the noble lord, our President, that we cannot go into the  question of a scheme.
At the same time I do not think it would be out  of the way to mention here that it would be of the utmost importance  to Canada that we should have some arrangement that there should be a  discriminating tariff established.
The effect would be to  open up a better state of trade than ever between the two countries.
I  feel that we in Canada would be willing to give for a discriminating  tariff very great advantages over foreign manufacturers with whom  the trade is now divided.
I think if this matter is only carefully  considered, it is not impossible for the English people, for the sake  of keeping the English nation together, to make this little sacrifice.
I have spoken to numbers of people in England, and I find a great many  would be willing to have some such arrangement made if England were  assured of some corresponding advantage.
They seem to think it is a  question which ought to be considered; but they think that England  has committed herself to another policy to which she must stand.
Well, I do not think that that is the case.
My opinion is that it  is to the interest of the Empire, and to the interest of the Mother  Country, that something should be done which would knit the Empire  together.
I believe the English people are open to reason as much as  any people in the world.
That policy would be of immense interest to  us considering that the United States are our competitors.
Then again  look at the advantages which might be offered in the way of emigration  to a country under your own flag, with your own institutions, and with  those law-abiding and God-fearing principles, which we are trying to  spread through the northern half of the continent; and at the same  time it would be adding strength to you all here at home.
I must not  detain you too long, but I thought I would like to mention these one  or two points to you.
I speak on behalf of the great masses of the  Canadian people, and I think I have shown you some of the annoyances  under which they have been living up to the present, and I am quite  sure that if any sacrifice can be made the Canadians will be willing  to meet you half-way.
But it ought not to be all one way.
There ought  to be give and take both ways.
During my speech I was loudly applauded, and felt that a large majority of the meeting was with me.
When I sat down, I was just behind Lord Rosebery, and to my astonishment he turned around, shook hands with me, and whispered in my ear, "I wish I could speak out as openly."
I knew then that I had neither frightened him nor the meeting.
The Report was unanimously adopted.
I felt that I had succeeded in my mission as far as the Imperial Federation League was concerned, but while I was on the spot I was using every effort to urge the views of my colleagues in other directions.
Believing that the two strongest men in England at the time were Lord Salisbury and the Colonial Secretary, Mr. Chamberlain, I had been at the same time endeavouring to impress our views upon them.
I had met Mr. Chamberlain in 1887 in Toronto, and had spoken at the same banquet which he there addressed.
I wrote and asked him for an interview, and discussed the whole question of preferential trade, and the condition of affairs in Canada with him at great length.
Our interview lasted nearly an hour.
I then used with him many arguments which he has since used in his contest in England for Tariff Reform.
After I had put my case as strongly as I could, I waited for his reply.
He said, "I have listened with great interest to all the points you have brought forward, and I shall study the whole question thoroughly for myself, and if, after full consideration, I come to the conclusion that this policy will be in the interests of this country and of the Empire, I shall take it up and advocate it."
I said, "That is all I want; if you look into it and study it for yourself you are sure to come to the same view," and got up to leave, but he then said to me with the greatest earnestness, "Do not tell a soul that I ever said I would think of such a thing.
In the present condition of opinion in England it would never do."
The result was that, though I was greatly cheered by his action, there was not one word that I could use, or that could be used, to help us in our struggle in Canada.
I always felt, however, that it was only a question of time when he would be heartily with us.
Lord Salisbury about this time invited me to an evening reception at 20 Arlington Street.
When there I mentioned to him shortly what I had come over for, and told him I wished to have a long talk with him if he could spare the time.
He said, "Certainly, we must have a talk," and he fixed the following Wednesday, the 14th May.
At this time there was an acute difficulty between the United States Government and the British Government over the seizures of Canadian vessels engaged in the Behring's Sea seal fisheries.
A number of Canadian vessels had been seized by United States cruisers, their crews imprisoned, and their property confiscated.
The Canadian Government had complained bitterly, and, after much discussion, two Canadian Ministers, Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper and Sir John Thompson, were in Washington engaged, with the assistance of the British Ambassador, in negotiations with the Hon.
James Blaine, United States Secretary of State, endeavouring to settle the Behring's Sea question, as well as several other matters which were in dispute.
Having watched matters very closely in the United States, I had come to the conclusion that the Washington authorities had no serious intention to settle anything finally.
We had made a treaty with them before in 1888, which had arranged the matters in dispute upon a fair basis, and when everything was agreed upon and settled, waiting only for the ratification by the United States Senate, that body threw it out promptly and left everything as it was.
This action was at once followed by the retaliation message delivered by President Cleveland, which was a most unfriendly and insulting menace to Canada.
I felt confident that they were determined to keep the disputes open for some future occasion, when Great Britain might be in difficulties, and a _casus belli_ might be convenient.
The New York _Daily Commercial Bulletin_ openly declared in November, 1888, that the questions of the fisheries, etc., "in all human probability will be purposely left open in order to force the greater issue (viz., political union) which, as it seems to us, none but a blind man can fail to see is already looming up with unmistakable distinctness in the future."
At this reception at Lord Salisbury's I was discussing the negotiations at Washington with Lord George Hamilton, then First Lord of the Admiralty, expressing my fears that they would come to nothing, and pointing out the dangers before us.
He seemed somewhat impressed, and said, "I wish you would talk it over with Sir Philip Currie," then permanent Under-Secretary of Foreign Affairs, and he took me across the room and introduced me to Sir Philip, to whom I expressed my opinion that the negotiations at Washington would fail and that the United States Government would not agree to anything.
While I was talking to him I was watching him closely, and I came to the conclusion, from his expression, that he was positively certain that the matter was either settled or on the very point of being settled, and I stopped suddenly and said, "I believe, Sir Philip, you think this is settled.
You know all about it, and I know nothing, but I tell you now, that although you may believe it is all agreed upon, I say that it is not, and that either the Senate or the House of Representatives, or the President, or all of them put together, will at the last moment upset everything."
I do not think he liked my persistence, or felt that the conversation was becoming difficult, but he laughed good-naturedly and said, "Nobody will make me believe that the Americans are not the most friendly people possible, but I must just go and speak to Lord ----" whose name I did not catch, and he left me.
The next week I had my interview with Lord Salisbury and put my arguments from an Imperial point of view as powerfully as I could, told him of the dangers of the Commercial Union movement, of the desperate struggle I could see coming in the general election that was approaching in Canada, told him of our dread of a free expenditure of United States money in our elections, and pointed out to him that the real way to prevent any difficulty was to have a preferential tariff or commercial union arrangement with Great Britain, which would satisfy our people, and entirely checkmate the movement in favour of reciprocity with the States.
Lord Salisbury listened attentively and at last he said, "I am fast coming to the opinion that the real way to consolidate the empire would be by means of a Zollverein and a Kriegsverein."
I was delighted, "That," I said, "gives me all my case," and I urged him to say something publicly in that direction that we could use in Canada to inspire our loyal people, and put that hope and confidence in them which would carry our elections.
He did not say whether he would or not, but I knew then that at heart he was with us.
As a matter of fact, he did speak in a friendly tone at the Lord Mayor's Banquet at the Guildhall on the 9th November following, and afterwards followed it up with a much more direct speech at Hastings on the 18th May, 1892.
I then said that nothing could be done until the German-Belgian Treaties of 1862 were denounced.
He asked me why, and I told him the effect of the treaties was to bar any such arrangement.
He did not know of the particular clauses and could hardly believe they existed.
When told he would find I was right, he said, "That is most unfortunate, and they will have to be denounced."
I thanked him for taking that view and felt that I had a strong ally on both points.
From subsequent conversations and from many letters received from him during the following ten or twelve years, I always relied upon him as a true friend who would help us at the first possible opportunity.
On this occasion I also spoke to him seriously as to my forebodings as to the failure of the negotiations at Washington and told him I believed he was under the impression that the matter was about settled, but warned him that at the last moment either the Senate or the President, or someone, would upset everything.
I had spoken very plainly at the Canada Club not long before on the Behring's Sea business, and some of my remarks were published in several papers.
On this point I said:   We in Canada are for the British Connection.
In years gone by when  we thought that the British flag was insulted, though it was not  a matter in which we were concerned and happened hundreds of miles  from our shores, our blood was up, and we were ready to defend the  old emblem.
Can you wonder, then, that we in Canada have failed to  understand how your powerful British ironclads could be idle in the  harbours of our Pacific coasts while British subjects were being  outraged in Behring's Sea and the old British flag insulted?
No, that  to us has been beyond comprehension.
Before I left England my anticipations were realised, and suddenly, without any apparent reason, President Harrison broke off the negotiations just as Mr. Blaine and our representatives had come to an agreement, and he gave orders to United States vessels to proceed at once to the Behring's Sea and capture any Canadian vessels found fishing in those waters.
This was about the end of May.
I sailed for home from Liverpool on the 5th June.
On the _Parisian_ I met as a fellow passenger the Rt.
After we had got out to sea he said to me, "I will tell you something that you must keep strictly to yourself for the present; when we reach the other side it will probably all be out," and he went on to say that the British Government had made up their minds to fight the United States on account of President Harrison's action.
I was startled, and asked him if they were going to declare war at once.
He replied, "No, not yet, but they have sent a message to the United States Government saying that if they seized another Canadian vessel it would be followed and taken from them by force from any harbour to which it would be taken."
I at once said, "That is all right; if that message is delivered in earnest, so that they will know that it is in earnest, it means peace and no further interference."
When we arrived at Quebec, to our surprise not a word had come out, and no one seemed to have the slightest suspicion that anything had happened.
Some weeks elapsed and yet nothing was said, and I was under the impression that there had been some mistake, although Mr. Staveley Hill told me he had heard it directly from a Cabinet Minister.
I saw in the newspapers that large additions were made to the Atlantic and Pacific fleets, the latter being more than doubled in strength.
About two months after my return a member of the House of Representatives got up in the United States Congress and drew attention to these extensive preparations, to the increase of the garrison of Bermuda, to the work going on in the fortifications of the West Indies, and asked that the House should be furnished with copies of the despatches between the two Governments.
These were brought down, and Lord Salisbury's ultimatum appeared in the following words:   Her Britannic Majesty's Government have learned with great concern,  from notices which have appeared in the Press, and the general  accuracy of which has been confirmed by Mr. Blaine's statements to  the undersigned, that the Government of the United States have issued  instructions to their revenue cruisers about to be despatched to  Behring's Sea, under which vessels of British subjects will again be  exposed in the prosecution of their legitimate industry on the high  seas to unlawful interference at the hands of American officers.
Her Britannic Majesty's Government are anxious to co-operate to the  fullest extent of their power with the Government of the United States  in such measures as may be found expedient for the protection of the  seal fisheries.
They are at the present moment engaged in examining,  in concert with the Government of the United States, the best method  of arriving at an agreement on this point.
But they cannot admit  the right of the United States of their own sole motion to restrict  for this purpose the freedom of navigation of Behring's Sea, which  the United States have themselves in former years convincingly and  successfully vindicated, nor to enforce their municipal legislation  against British vessels on the high seas beyond the limits of their  territorial jurisdiction.
Her Britannic Majesty's Government is therefore unable to pass over  without notice the public announcement of an intention on the part of  the Government of the United States to renew the acts of interference  with British vessels navigating outside the territorial waters of the  United States, of which they had previously had to complain.
The undersigned is in consequence instructed formally to protest  against such interference, and to declare that her Britannic Majesty's  Government must hold the Government of the United States responsible  for the consequences that may ensue from acts which are contrary to  the established principles of International law.
The undersigned has the honour to renew to Mr. Blaine the assurance of  his highest consideration.
_14th June, 1890._  This correspondence showed me that the information given Mr. Staveley Hill had been based upon a good foundation, but this was followed in Congress a few days later by a demand for a return of a verbal message which was said to have been given by the British Ambassador to the Hon.
James Blaine.
The answer was that a search in the records of the State Department did not discover any reference to any such verbal message.
I have no doubt but that some such message was given.
About a year afterwards I was discussing matters with Sir C. Hibbert Tupper, and I asked him if when they were in Washington they were not at one time quite confident that the matter was practically settled.
He said, "Yes, certainly; we had been discussing matters in a most amicable way, and had been coming nearer together, and at last we agreed to what we thought was a final settlement, when President Harrison interfered and broke off the whole negotiations."
Lord Salisbury's bold and determined action had the desired effect, and soon an agreement was arrived at for an arbitration, which took place in Paris in 1893.
In spite of the false translations and unreliable and false affidavits which appeared among the evidence produced on behalf of the United States claims, the decision on the point of International law was in our favour, and a large sum was awarded to our sealers for damages.
Canada therefore came out of the dispute with credit to herself, owing to the firm and courageous stand of the Imperial Government under the leadership of that great Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury.
My forecast to him of what he was likely to encounter in the negotiations was fully verified.
Our Committee was still working earnestly in stirring up the feeling of loyalty, and from that time until the great election of March, 1891, the struggle was energetically maintained.
Arrangements were made for demonstrations in the public schools on the 13th October, 1890, the anniversary of the victory of Queenston Heights, and on that day a number of prominent men visited the schools of Toronto and made patriotic addresses to the boys.
I addressed the John Street Public School, and afterwards the boys of Upper Canada College.
The _Globe_ attacked me on account of these celebrations in their issue on 13th October, and followed it up with another article on the 14th October.
I answered both articles in a letter which appeared in the _Globe_ of the 16th October, and concluded as follows:   As to your remarks that I should abstain from interfering "in the  discussion of questions that have become party property," I may say  that before I was appointed Police Magistrate I was a follower of  Mr. Brown, Mr. Mackenzie, Mr. Blake, and Mr. Mowat.
Since then I  have never voted or taken part in any political meeting.
Not that  the law prevents it, but from my sense of what I thought right.
I  may say, however, on behalf of the friends with whom I used to work,  that I utterly repudiate the suggestion that loyalty to Canada and  her history is not equally the characteristic of both parties.
There  are a few, I know, who are intriguing to betray this country into  annexation, but they are not the men I followed, and when the scheme  is fully developed I have every confidence that Canadians of all  political parties will be united on the side of Canada and the Empire.
No politicians can rule Canada unless they are loyal.
On any question affecting our national life I will speak out openly  and fearlessly at all hazards.
About the same time the _Empire_ newspaper, to help on the movement and to advertise it, offered a flag (12 feet by 6 feet in size), the Canadian red ensign with the arms of Canada in the fly, to that school in each county which could produce the finest essay on the patriotic influence of raising the flag over the school houses.
Each school was to compete within itself, and the best essay was to be chosen by the headmaster and sent to the _Empire_ office.
These essays from each county were carefully compared, and the finest essay secured the flag for the school from which it came.
I read the essays and awarded the prizes for about thirty counties, and it was a pleasing and inspiring task.
I was astonished at the depth of patriotic feeling shown, and was much impressed with the great influence the contest must have had in stirring up the latent patriotism of the people, spreading as it did into so many houses through the children.
I was so much interested in what I read, and often found so much difficulty in deciding which was the best essay, that I felt that they all deserved prizes.
I therefore decided to prepare a little volume of patriotic songs and poems, and to publish a large number and send a copy to the child in each school who had written the best essay, and a copy was also sent to the master of every school that had sent in an essay.
I wrote to my friend Mr. E. G. Nelson, Secretary of the Branch of our League at St. John, New Brunswick, and told him what I was doing.
I soon received from him a copy of a song, which he said my letter had inspired him to write.
It was called "Raise the Flag."
I give the first verse:      Raise the flag, our glorious banner,     O'er this fair Canadian land,     From the stern Atlantic ocean     To the far Pacific strand.
_Chorus._      Raise the flag with shouts of gladness,     'Tis the banner of the free!
Brightly beaming, proudly streaming,     'Tis the flag of liberty.
On the front of the stiff cardboard cover a well-executed, brightly-coloured lithograph of a school-house with a fine maple tree beside it was seen, with a large number of children, boys and girls, waving their hats and handkerchiefs and acclaiming the flag which was being run up to the top of the flag-pole, the master apparently giving the signal for cheering.
On the back of the cover was a pretty view of Queenston Heights, with Brock's monument the prominent object, and over this scene a trophy of crossed flags with a medallion containing Queen Victoria's portrait imposed on one, and a shield with the arms of Canada on the other.
Over both was the motto "For Queen and Country."
On the title page a verse of Lesperance's beautiful poem was printed just below the title.
It contained in a few words all that we were fighting for, the object we were aiming at, and the spirit we wished to inspire in the children of our country:      Shall we break the plight of youth       And pledge us to an alien love?
we hold our faith and truth,       Trusting to the God above.
Stand Canadians, firmly stand     Round the flag of Fatherland.
I asked a number of friends to assist me in the expense of getting out this book, and I feel bound to record their names here as loyal men who gave me cheerful assistance and joined me in supplying all the necessary funds at a time when we had many vigorous opponents and had to struggle against indifference and apathy:--George Gooderham, John T. Small, John Hoskin, J. K. Macdonald, J. Herbert Mason, Edward Gurney, Wm.
K. McNaught, W. R. Brock, Allan McLean Howard, A. M. Cosby, Walter S. Lee, Hugh Scott, Thomas Walmsley, W. H. Beatty, A.
B. Lee, John Leys, Jr., E. B. Osler, John I. Davidson, J. Ross Robertson, Hugh Blain, Hon.
G. W. Allan, Henry Cawthra, Fred C. Denison, Oliver Macklem, G. R. R. Cockburn, James Henderson, R. N. Bethune, Sir Casimir Gzowski, C. J. Campbell and W. B. Hamilton.
We published a good many thousand volumes and scattered them freely through the country before the election of 1891.
I gave Lord Derby, then Governor-General of Canada, about a dozen copies, and he sent one to the Queen, and some months after he received a letter from Sir Henry Ponsonby asking him at the request of the Queen to thank me for the book.
When the schools throughout the country received the flags which they had won, in many instances demonstrations were organised to raise the flag for the first time with due ceremony.
I was invited to go to Chippawa to speak when their flag was first raised.
There was a very large gathering of people from all over the county, and as an illustration of how the opportunity was used to stir up the patriotism of the people, I quote part of my address from the _Empire_ of the 30th December, 1890.
I am pleased to come here to celebrate the raising of the flag,  because Chippawa is in the very heart of the historic ground of  Canada.
Here was fought out in the past the freedom of Canada from  foreign aggression.
Here was decided the question as to whether we  should be a conquered people, or free as we are to-day, with the old  flag of our fathers floating over us as a portion of the greatest  empire in the world.
(Applause.)
In sight of this spot was fought the  bloody battle which is named after this village, within three miles in  the other direction lies the field of Lundy's Lane, and a few miles  beyond the Heights of Queenston.
From Fort George to Fort Erie the  whole country has been fought over.
Under the windows of this room  Sir Francis Bond Head in 1837 reviewed about three thousand loyal  militia who rallied to drive the enemy from Navy Island.
It is no  wonder that here in old Chippawa the demonstration of raising the flag  should be such a magnificent outburst of loyal feeling .
There is  nothing more gratifying than the extraordinary development of this  feeling in the last year or two.
All through the land is shown this  love for Queen, flag, and country.
From the complaining of some few  disgruntled politicians, who have been going about the country whining  like a lot of sick cats about the McKinley Bill, some have thought  our people were not united; but everywhere, encompassing these men,  stands the silent element that doth not change, and if the necessity  arise for greater effort, and the display of greater patriotism, and  the making of greater sacrifices, the people of this country will  rise to the occasion.
(Loud applause.)
The cause of this outgrowth of  patriotic feeling has been the belief that a conspiracy has been on  foot to betray this country into annexation.
The McKinley Bill was  part of the scheme.
But are you, the men of Welland, the men whose  fathers abandoned everything--their homes, and lands and the graves of  their dead--to come here penniless, to live under the flag of their  ancestors, are you likely to sell your allegiance, your flag and your  country, for a few cents a bushel on grain, or a cent or two a dozen  on eggs?
(Loud applause.)
the men of this country are loyal.
No  leader of either party can lead any important fraction of his party  into disloyalty.
We may have a still greater strain put upon us.
If  the conspirators believe that stoppage of the bonding privileges will  coerce us, the bonding privileges will be stopped.
If so, we must  set our teeth and stiffen our sinews to face it (applause), and the  more loyal we are, the more prosperous and successful we will be.
Our contemptuous treatment of the McKinley Bill had, I believe, a  great influence in the defeat of the Republicans, and may cause the  repeal of the Bill, and then when we get freer trade we will keep  it, because our neighbours will know that we cannot be coerced into  being untrue to our traditions.
In whatever you do put the interest of  Canada first, first before politics and everything.
(Loud applause.)
I addressed a number of meetings during the fall of the year and winter, all on patriotic subjects, endeavouring to arouse the people against Reciprocity or Annexation, and urging Imperial Unity as the goal for Canadians to aim at.
I spoke on the 11th September, 9th October, 5th December, 29th December, 9th January, 1891, 19th January, 27th February, and the 17th March.
I had written in February, 1890, as already mentioned, to Sir John A. Macdonald expressing my opinion that the next election would be fought on the question of loyalty as against disloyalty.
All through the year I became more and more convinced of this, and foresaw that if the elections were postponed until 1892 it would give the Commercial Unionists and Annexationists more time to organise, and, what I dreaded most, give more time to our enemies in the United States to prepare the way for an election favourable to their views.
I cannot do better to show the trend of affairs than copy from the _Empire_ of the 7th February, 1890.
After referring to the disloyalty of Premier Mercier of Quebec, and quoting a statement of the Toronto _Globe_ that the Canadian people "find the colonial yoke a galling one" and that "the time when Canadian patriotism was synonymous with loyalty to British connection has long since gone by," the article copies the extract from the New York _World_ in which it states that "Nobody who has studied the peculiar methods by which elections are won in Canada will deny the fact that five or six million dollars judiciously expended in this country would secure the return to Parliament of a majority pledged to the annexation of Canada to the United States," and then goes on to say:   This dastardly insult to our country is not only the work to order  of a member of the staff of the New York _World_ but is adopted and  emphasised by it with all the parade of display headings and of the  black letter which we reproduce as in the original.
So these plotters  are contemplating the wholesale purchase of our country by the  corruption of the electors on this gigantic scale, to return members  ready to surrender Canada to a foreign Power.
And for such insults as  these we have mainly to thank the dastardly traitors who from our own  land have by their secret information and encouragement to the foreign  coveters of our country invited the insulting attack.
By such baseness  our enemies have been taught to believe that we will fall easy victims  to their designs.
Again, as so often before, we find the well deserved tribute to our  Conservative statesmen that they are the bulwark of Canada against  such assaults.
Friends and enemies are fully in accord on this one  point; that the opposition are not similarly true to their country  is clearly indicated in this outspoken report, and it may also be  observed that every individual or journal mentioned as favouring  annexation is of the most pronounced grit stripe.
It is, however,  by no means true that the whole Liberal party is tainted with this  treasonable virus.
By thousands they are withdrawing from the leaders  who are paltering with such a conspiracy, and are uniting themselves  with the Conservatives to defend their country.
Not the boasted six  millions of United States dollars will tempt these loyal Canadians to  sell their country.
It is well, however, that Canada should thus be  forewarned.
Watching all we could learn of these movements, I became very anxious that the election should take place before another session.
My brother, the member for West Toronto, agreed strongly with me on this point.
Sir John Macdonald was gradually coming around to that view, but most of his colleagues differed from him.
My brother happened to be in his office one day when several of the Cabinet were present, and Sir John asked him when he thought the election should come on.
He replied, "As soon as possible," and urged that view strongly.
Sir John turned to his colleagues and said, "There, you see, is another."
This showed his difficulty.
There had been some rumours of intrigues between some members of the Liberal party and the United States politicians.
Sir Richard Cartwright was known to have gone down secretly to Washington to confer with Mr. Blaine, principally, it was believed, through the influence of Erastus Wiman.
Honore Mercier was also believed to have been mixed up in the intrigues.
In the month of November I had been able to obtain some private information in connection with these negotiations, and I went down to Ottawa on the 8th December, 1890, and had a private conference with Sir John Macdonald and gave him all the information I had gathered.
I told him that Blaine and Sir Richard Cartwright had had a conference in Washington, and that Mr. Blaine had thanked Mr. Wiman for bringing Sir Richard to see him.
During the autumn of 1890, Edward Farrer, then editor of the _Globe_, and one of the conspirators who were working for annexation, prepared a pamphlet of a most treacherous character, pointing out how best the United States could act to encourage and force on annexation.
He had the pamphlet printed secretly with great care, only thirteen copies being printed for use among a few of the leading United States politicians.
In Hunter, Rose and Co.'s printing office where it was being printed, there was a compositor who happened to know Mr. Farrer's handwriting, and who set up part of the type.
He was struck with the traitorous character of the production, and gave information about it to Sir C. Hibbert Tupper, then in the Government.
He reported it to Sir John Macdonald, and the latter sent Col. Sherwood, the chief of the Dominion police force, to Toronto, and told him to consult with me, and that I could administer the oath to the compositor, who swore to affidavits proving the circumstances connected with the printing of the pamphlet.
The printer had proof slips of two or three pages when Col. Sherwood brought him to my office, and it was arranged that any more that he could get he was to bring to me, and I would prepare the affidavits and forward them on to Col. Sherwood.
The proof sheets were watched so closely and taken back so carefully after the corrections were made, that it was impossible to get any of them, but the printer who gave us the information was able at the dinner hour to take a roller, and ink the pages of type after the printing had been finished and before the type had been distributed.
The impressions were taken in the most rough and primitive way, and as he had only a few chances of doing the work without detection, he was only able to bring me about two-thirds of the pamphlet.
These portions, however, contained enough to show the drift of the whole work, and gave Sir John Macdonald quite sufficient quotations to use in a public speech at Toronto in the opening of the election to prove the intrigues that were going on.
The revelation had a marked influence on the election, not only in Toronto, but from one end of Canada to the other.
It was a mystery to Farrer and the printers how Sir John had obtained a copy, for they assumed he had a complete copy.
They were able to trace the thirteen copies, and Mr. Rose was satisfied no more had been printed.
He gave me his theory shortly after, and I was amused to see how absolutely wrong he was.
He had no idea that I knew anything about it.
The secret was well kept.
The printer who gave them to us, Col. Sherwood, Sir Hibbert Tupper, David Creighton, Sir John Macdonald, and myself, I have heard, were the only persons in the secret until the day Sir John brought it out at the great meeting in the Princess Theatre.
In January, 1891, Sir John Macdonald came to Toronto.
He was anxious to see me without attracting attention, and my brother Fred arranged for him to come to my office at an hour when the officials would be away for lunch, and we had a conference for about three-quarters of an hour.
He was very anxious to get a letter to publish the substance of which I had known and which would have thrown much light upon the intrigues between two or three Liberal leaders and some of the United States politicians.
I said I would do what I could to get the information, but I did not succeed.
Before he left he asked me what I thought of bringing on the elections at once, or of waiting till the following year.
I jumped up from my chair at the suggestion that he was in doubt, and said, "What, Sir John; in the face of all you know and all I know, can you hesitate an instant?
You must bring the elections on at once.
If you wait till your enemies are ready, and the pipes are laid to distribute the money which will in time be given from the States, you will incur great danger, and no one can tell where the trouble will end."
I spoke very earnestly and Sir John listened with a smile, and got up to leave, saying to me, "Keep all your muscles braced up, and your nerves all prepared, so that if the House is suddenly dissolved in about three weeks you will not receive a nervous shock, but keep absolutely silent."
He said this in a very humorous and quizzical way which was characteristic of him, and went off wagging his head from side to side as was his wont.
I knew about Farrer's pamphlet and about other things which came out in this election, and I had two very warm friends in the Liberal Government of Ontario, Sir Oliver Mowat and the Hon.
G. W. Ross.
I did not wish them to be mixed up with any political scandal that might come out, nor did I wish them to commit themselves definitely to the party at Ottawa, who were advocating a policy which I was sure could not succeed, and the real meaning of which they could not support.
I told them both I thought there would be unpleasant matters divulged, and begged of them to keep as far away from the election as they could.
They both seemed to take what I said in good part, and they adjourned the session of the local Legislature till after the general election.
Mr. Mowat arranged that his son Arthur Mowat was to run in West Toronto, and he spoke for him in his constituency, and also for the Honourable Alexander Mackenzie in East York.
He made several speeches, all most loyal and patriotic in their tone.
Mr. Ross spoke once in his own constituency.
I told him after the election when it went against the Liberal party, that I had given him fair warning.
He said, "Yes, but I only made one speech in my own constituency."
Sir Oliver Mowat's assistance in Ontario saved the Liberal party in that Province from a most disastrous defeat, for the people had confidence in him and in his steadfast loyalty.
When the election was going on, my brother said one day to me, "I think I shall defeat Mowat by four or five hundred."
I replied, "Your majority will be nearer two thousand than one thousand."
He said, "That is absurd; there never was such a majority in the city."
I answered, "I know the feeling in Toronto," and using a cavalry simile said, "She is up on her hind legs, pawing the air, and you will see you will have nearly two thousand."
The figure was one thousand seven hundred and sixty-nine, the largest majority in Ontario, I believe, in that election.
The election supported the Macdonald Government with a large majority in the House and practically finished the attempt to entrap Canada into annexation through the means of tariff entanglements.
Although dangerous intrigues went on for several years, they were neutralised by the loyal work of Sir Oliver Mowat and the Hon.
G. W. Ross.
After leaving Oxford in 1868 he went to the United States, where he lectured at Cornell University for two or three years.
Having taken part in a controversy in the Press over the Alabama question, in which he took the side of Great Britain, he aroused a good deal of hostility and criticism in the United States.
In 1871 he removed to Toronto where he has ever since resided.
He had some relatives living in Toronto in the suburb then known as Brockton.
My father and I, two uncles, and a cousin then lived in that district, in which my house is situated, and we had a small social circle into which Mr. Goldwin Smith was warmly welcomed.
He shortly after bought a house from my father near to his place, and we soon became close friends.
In my father's lifetime Mr. Smith belonged to a small whist club consisting of my father, my uncle Richard, Major Shaw, and himself.
After my father's death I took his place, and we played in each other's houses for some years, until Mr. Smith married the widow of Wm.
Henry Boulton and took up his home in "The Grange."
The distance at which he lived from us was then inconvenient, and in a few months we discontinued the club.
In 1872 Mr. Smith was the prime mover in starting the _Canadian Monthly_ and asked me to contribute an article for the first number, and afterwards I contributed one or two more.
At one time we contemplated writing a joint history of the American Civil War, in which I was to write the military part and he was to write the political.
I even went to Gettysburg to examine the battlefield, and began to gather material, when we discovered that it would be a long and laborious work, and that under the copyright law at the time there would be no security as to our rights in the United States, as we were not citizens of the republic.
So the project was abandoned.
For many years Goldwin Smith and I were close friends, and I formed a very high opinion of him in many ways, and admired him for many estimable qualities.
When the Commercial Union movement began, however, I found that I had to take a very decided stand against him, and very soon a keen controversy arose between us and it ended in my becoming one of the leaders in the movement against him and his designs.
When he assumed the Honorary Presidency of the Continental Union Association, formed both in Canada and in the United States, and working in unison to bring about the annexation of the two countries, I looked upon that as rank treason, and ceased all association with him, and since then we have never spoken.
I regretted much the rupture of the old ties of friendship, but felt that treason could not be handled with kid gloves.
I shall now endeavour to give an account of the contest between us, because I am sure it had a distinct influence upon public opinion, and helped to arouse the latent loyalty of the Canadian people, and for the time at any rate helped to kill the annexation movement in Canada.
I have already mentioned the incident of the dinner at the National Club where I said I would only discuss seriously annexation or independence with my sword.
I did not think at that time that Mr. Smith was discussing the question in any other than a purely academic spirit; subsequent developments have satisfied me that even then he cherished designs that from my point of view were treasonable.
In the early spring of 1887, Mr. Goldwin Smith was at Washington and went on to Old Point Comfort and became acquainted with Erastus Wiman, who was staying at the same hotel and who showed Mr. Smith some courtesy.
Mr. Smith invited Wiman to pay him a visit in Toronto in the latter part of May, 1887, and shortly after it was found that the strongest supporter that Wiman had for his Commercial Union agitation was Mr. Goldwin Smith.
As I have already said, during 1888-9-90, I was frequently addressing public meetings and speaking at banquets of all sorts of societies and organisations.
We had also started the raising of the flags in the schools, the decoration of monuments, the singing of patriotic songs, &c., and generally we were waging a very active campaign against the Commercial Union movement.
In 1891, the most dangerous crisis of the struggle, Mr. Smith commenced a series of lectures which were cleverly intended to sap the loyalty of our people and neutralise the effect of our work.
The three lectures were delivered before the Young Men's Liberal Club of Toronto.
The first was on "Loyalty" and was delivered on the 2nd February, 1891, and was intended to ridicule and belittle the idea of loyalty.
In reply to this I prepared at once a lecture on the United Empire Loyalists which I delivered at the Normal School to a meeting of school teachers and scholars on the 27th of the same month.
On the 11th May, 1891, Goldwin Smith delivered his second lecture on "Aristocracy."
I saw now that there was a deliberate and treasonable design in these lectures to undermine the loyal sentiment that held Canada to the Empire, and as there was danger at any time of open trouble, I replied to this in another way.
I delivered a lecture on the opening of the war of 1812 to point out clearly how much the loyal men were hampered by traitors at the opening of the war of 1812, and how they dealt with them then, how seven had been hanged at Ancaster, many imprisoned, and many driven out of the country, and I endeavoured to encourage our people with the reflection that the same line of action would help us again in the same kind of danger.
On the 17th April, 1891, this lecture was delivered before the Birmingham Lodge of the Sons of England.
On the 9th of the following November Goldwin Smith delivered his third lecture entitled "Jingoism."
This was a direct attack on me and on what my friends and I were doing.
This lecture aroused great indignation among the loyal people.
I was asked by the Supreme Grand Lodge of the Sons of England to deliver a lecture in reply at a meeting to be called under their auspices, which it was intended should be a popular demonstration against Goldwin Smith, and a proof of the repudiation by the Toronto people of his views.
The meeting was held in Shaftesbury Hall, then the largest room in the city for such purposes, and it was packed to the doors.
My lecture was entitled "National Spirit," and was delivered on the 17th December, 1891.
Referring to this lecture the _Empire_ of the 18th December, 1891, commented as follows:   The fervour and appreciation of the large audience which assembled  in the auditorium last evening to hear Colonel George T. Denison  were undoubtedly due in great measure to the well-known ability of  the lecturer and to the intrinsic qualities of the lecture--its wide  range of fact, its high and patriotic purpose, the eloquence with  which great historic truths were imparted--but its enthusiastic  reception was due none the less to the fact that the lecturer struck  a responsive note in the breasts of his hearers, and that he was  expressing views which are the views of the ordinary Canadian, and  which at this time are especially deserving of clear and emphatic  enunciation.
In marked contrast to the enthusiasm of this immense gathering was  the small handful of disgruntled fledglings and annexationists who  assembled lately in some obscure meeting place to hear the sentiments  of Professor Goldwin Smith, though even there the respectable Liberal  element was strong enough to utter a protest against the annexationist  views of the Professor.
For several years there has been afoot a determined attempt, promoted  on its literary side by the writings and addresses of Professor  Goldwin Smith, to undermine the national spirit, to disturb the  national unity, and to arouse the latent impatience of an intensely  practical people for any displays of the pride, the courage, and the  patriotic sentiment of the country.
By elaborate sneers at "loyalty,"  at "aristocracy," at "jingoism"; by perverting history, by appealing  to the cupidity which always has temptations for a small section  of every nation, this propaganda has been kept up persistently and  malignantly, and it was not unfitting that Colonel Denison, who  has been a foremost figure in stemming the movement by encouraging  patriotic displays and honouring the memories of national heroes,  should have met the enemy in the literary arena, and vindicated there,  too, the righteousness and wisdom of encouraging national spirit.
He has boldly met Professor Goldwin Smith's appeal to history, and  triumphantly proved his case, and presents in this lecture to all  thoughtful men, to all students of the past, incontrovertible evidence  that the efforts being made in Canada to stimulate national patriotism  and enthusiasm are in accordance with the experience of every virile  and enduring race since the beginning of the world, and in thorough  harmony with the experience of every young and developing community.
Goldwin Smith addressed a meeting at Innerkip on the 4th October, 1892.
He spoke on the question of freedom of speech, in defence of Elgin Myers, who had been dismissed from his position of Crown Attorney at Orangeville by Sir Oliver Mowat for publicly advocating annexation.
I answered him in a speech at the banquet of the Kent Lodge of the Sons of England on the 11th October, 1892.
As you have for many years been an  earnest advocate of the reunion of the English-speaking people  on this continent, it is considered fitting that you should fill  this position.
I am desired to add that your acceptance would not  necessarily involve your attendance at our meetings nor require you to  take an active part.
The Secretary of the Continental Association of Ontario.
From active participation in any political movement I have found it  necessary to retire.
Your object, as I understand it, is to procure by constitutional  means, and with the consent of the mother country, the submission of  the question of continental union to the free suffrage of the Canadian  people, and to furnish the people with the information necessary to  prepare them for the vote.
In this there can be nothing unlawful or  disloyal.
That a change must come, the returns of the census, the condition of  our industries, especially of our farming industry, and the exodus of  the flower of our population, too clearly show.
Sentiment is not to  be disregarded, but genuine sentiment is never at variance with the  public good.
Love of the mother country can be stronger in no heart  than it is in mine; but I have satisfied myself that the interest of  Great Britain and that of Canada are one.
Let the debate be conducted in a spirit worthy of the subject.
Respect  the feelings and the traditions of those who differ from us, while  you firmly insist on the right of the Canadian people to perfect  freedom of thought and speech respecting the question of its own  destiny.
In March, 1893, an interesting episode in the struggle between the loyal people and Goldwin Smith occurred in connection with the St. George's Society, a most respectable and influential organisation of Englishmen and sons of Englishmen, formed for benevolent purposes.
Mr. Goldwin Smith was a life member and a very generous contributor to the charitable funds of the Society.
His open and active hostility to the Empire and to Canada's best interests, however, aroused a very bitter feeling of resentment, and in February, 1893, Mr. J. Castell Hopkins gave notice of motion of a resolution in the following words:   Resolved, that in view of his advocacy of the annexation of the  Dominion of Canada to the United States, his position as President  of the Continental Union Association of Toronto, and the treason to  his Sovereign to England and to Canada involved in these conditions,  this body of loyal Englishmen request Mr. Goldwin Smith to tender his  resignation as a life member of the St. George's Society, and hereby  instruct the treasurer to return to Mr. Smith the fee previously paid  for that privilege.
This notice of motion aroused much heated discussion in the Press, numbers of letters being written strongly supporting Mr. Hopkins's resolution, one "member of the Society" writing under that name, quoted the object of the Society in its constitution "to unite Englishmen and their descendants in a social compact for the promotion of mutual and friendly intercourse," and he went on to say that there could be "no mutual and friendly intercourse between a true-hearted, honest, loyal Englishman and a traitor and enemy of England's power and position.
If the St. George's Society does not speak out with no uncertain sound it will be a disgrace to the Englishmen of Toronto and be a death blow to the Society.
Most Englishmen would as soon join a society for friendly intercourse that contained thieves as one that contained traitors.
The thief might steal one's money.
The annexationist is striving to steal our birthright, our name, our place in history, and the lives of the thousands who would die in defence of their country and its institutions."
A number of our Imperialists who belonged to the Society formed a committee to organise a plan of action.
This committee met in my office.
We were not satisfied with Mr. Hopkins's resolution, as it asked Goldwin Smith to resign, which he could easily avoid doing and so put the Society in a false position.
On the afternoon of the day of the meeting our committee decided on a resolution which it was thought could be carried as a compromise.
When the meeting was held after there had been considerable discussion, all upon the proper course of action, a committee was appointed to draft a resolution as a compromise, and the one we had prepared was adopted and carried unanimously.
It was in the following terms:   Whereas it has been brought to the attention of this Society that Mr.  Goldwin Smith, one of its life members, has openly proclaimed himself  in favour of severing Canada from the rest of the British Empire, and  has also accepted the office of honorary president of an association  having for its object the active promotion of an agitation for the  union of Canada with the United States, therefore this Society desires  emphatically to place on record its strong disapprobation of any such  movement, and hereby expresses its extreme regret that the Society  should contain in its ranks a member who is striving for an object  which would cause an irreparable injury to the Dominion, would entail  a loss to the motherland of a most important part of her Empire, and  would deprive Canadians of their birthright as British subjects.
This was soon followed by Mr. Smith's resignation from the Society.
In spite of Mr. Goldwin Smith's farewells he had an article in the _Contemporary Review_ for January, 1895, on the Ottawa Conference of 1894.
After reflecting on the manner in which the "delegates" were appointed, he went on to say the conference confined itself to discussing trade relations and communications, and that defence "was excluded by omission."
He sneered at the French Militia who served in the North-West Rebellion, and attacked the Canadian-Pacific Railway, insinuating that it would be blocked in case of war, because part of it went through the State of Maine.
He made a great deal of snow blocks also, and even said that the prediction made when the Canadian-Pacific Railway "was built, that the road would never pay for the grease on its axle wheels, though then derided as false, has, in fact, proved too true," and he absolutely stated that "as a wheat-growing speculation, the region has failed."
The whole article was as inimical to Canada and the aspirations of the people as he with his literary ability and indifference as to facts could make it.
This article aroused a good deal of criticism and hostility all over Canada.
I received many letters from various parts of Canada, some from friends, some from strangers, asking me to reply to it.
Sir Oliver Mowat urged me very strongly to answer it.
I therefore prepared an article and sent it to the editor of the _Contemporary_ with a request that he should publish it.
I wanted no remuneration, but claimed the right to answer many inaccuracies.
But I do not think that you need fear misconstruction.
We know Mr.  Goldwin Smith as a man of great ability and cultivation, but he is not  taken as a representative of the bulk of Canadian opinion.
With this letter came my manuscript returned to me by same mail.
I am glad to find that you do not take Goldwin Smith as a  representative of the bulk of Canadian opinion, and can only express  the regret of Canadians generally that his distorted and incorrect  views about our country are so widely circulated in England.
This is  the more unfortunate when the bulk of Canadian opinion is refused a  hearing.
Yours, etc.
I then sent the manuscript back to England to my friend Dr. George R. Parkin, and asked him to get it published in some magazine.
After considerable delay, he succeeded in getting it in the _Westminster Review_ for September, 1895.
It was received very well in Canada, many notices and copious extracts being printed in many of our papers.
The _Week_ published the whole article in pamphlet form as a supplement.
In the following January, the Press Association having invited Mr. Goldwin Smith to their annual banquet to respond with the Hon.
G. W. Ross to the toast "Canada," some objection was raised by Mr. Castell Hopkins to his being endorsed to that extent.
Mr. Hopkins was attacked for this in the _Globe_.
I replied in his defence in the following letter, which explains why we of the Imperialist party followed Goldwin Smith so persistently and endeavoured to weaken his influence.
You say Mr. Hopkins's pursuit of Mr. Smith has become ridiculous, and  you refer to the St. George's Society incident.
As one who was present  and took part in that affair, I may say that the feeling was that the  fact of Mr. Smith being a member of the society gave him a recognition  as an Englishman that he was not entitled to, in view of his hostility  to the best interests of the empire.
Your editorial admits that Mr. Goldwin Smith "is a sincere advocate  of political union."
If so, he is a traitor to our constitution and  our country.
This political-union idea is no new or merely polemic  discussion.
It was advocated in 1775, and was crushed out by the  strength of the Canadian people.
It was advocated again in 1812, and  again it brought war and bloodshed and misery upon our people, and by  the lavish expenditure of Canadian lives our country and institutions  were preserved.
Again in 1837 it was advocated, and again produced  bloodshed, and once more Canadian lives were lost in preventing it.
Mr. Goldwin Smith knows this, or ought to, and he is the most potent  element to-day in preparing the Yankee mind to take up the question  of annexation.
A belief in the States that we were favourable to  annexation would do more than any possible cause to bring on an  attempt to secure annexation by force.
This belief led to the attempts  in 1775 and 1812.
In view of this, Goldwin Smith's conduct is treason of the worst  kind.
Such persistent hostility to the national life in any other  country would not be tolerated for an instant.
In Russia, under like  circumstances, Goldwin Smith would long since have been consigned  to the mines of Siberia.
In Germany or Austria he would have been  imprisoned.
In France he would have been consigned to the same convict  settlement as the traitor Dreyfus; while in the United States he would  long since have been lynched.
In the British Empire alone would he be  safe--for he has found here in Canada the freest constitution, and  the most tolerant and law-abiding people on earth, and these British  institutions, under whose protection he is working against us, our  people are determined to uphold at all hazards.
I would not object to Mr. Smith appearing at any public function but  that I feel it gives aid to him in misrepresenting and injuring our  country.
In 1812 we had just such men in Willcocks, Mallory, and  Marcle, members of the House of Assembly, whose intrigues did much to  bring war upon us.
These men, as soon as the war broke out, went over  to the enemy and fought against us, and Willcocks was killed in action  fighting against Canada.
Goldwin Smith will not follow his prototypes  so far.
On the first sign of danger he will escape, and settling in  some comfortable retreat, probably among the orange groves on the  Riviera, or perhaps in a villa on one of the Italian lakes, he will  watch the struggle from afar, while "the overwhelming majority" of the  opponents of political union in this country, or in other words the  Canadian people, would be engaged in a fearful struggle in the defence  of their native land and all that they hold dear.
Those who know Mr.  Smith best will readily imagine the sardonic smile with which he would  read of our losses in action, of our difficulties, and the untold  miseries that war always brings upon a people.
I ask the Press Association if it is fair to their fellow-Canadians to  allow our bitterest and most dangerous enemy to speak on behalf of our  country?
Is it fair to ask a loyal man like the Hon.
G. W. Ross, who  believes in Canada, to be coupled with a traitor?
Among the other methods of arousing the patriotic feeling of our people was the erection of monuments on our great battlefields in memory of the victories gained in the struggle to preserve the freedom of our country in 1812-'14.
The Lundy's Lane Historical Society, one of the patriotic organisations which sprang up over the Province, had started a movement for erecting a monument on the field of Lundy's Lane where the last important and the most hotly contested battle of the war took place in July, 1814.
They had collected a number of subscriptions but not sufficient for the purpose, when Goldwin Smith offered through the late Oliver A. Howland to supply the balance required, provided that he might write the inscription so as to include both armies in the commemoration on equal terms.
This offer was promptly declined by the Society, which had no desire to honour invaders who had made a most unprovoked attack upon a sparse people, who had nothing whatever to do with the assumed cause of the quarrel.
Shortly after, the Canadian Government took the matter in hand, and provided the balance required for the Lundy's Lane Monument, and the full amounts required for monuments on the fields of Chateauguay and Chrysler's Farm.
The Lundy's Lane Monument was finished and ready to be unveiled on the anniversary of the battle, the 25th July, 1895, and the Secretary of State, the Hon.
W. H. Montague, had promised to unveil it and deliver an address.
The day before Dr. Montague telegraphed to me that he could not go, and asked me to go on behalf of the Government and unveil the monument.
I agreed, and he telegraphed to the President of the Society that I was coming.
About two thousand people were assembled.
It will be remembered that Mr. Goldwin Smith had commented severely upon the proposal to put up a monument at Lundy's Lane, in his lecture on "Jingoism" delivered in 1891.
He said, "Only let it be like that monument at Quebec, a sign at once of gratitude and of reconciliation, not of the meanness of unslaked hatred."
I replied to this in my lecture on "National Spirit" shortly after, and said that the Professor, "considering how he is always treating a country that has used him far better than he ever deserved, should be a first-class authority on the meanness of unslaked and unfounded hatred."
At the time of the unveiling of the monument, when speaking in the presence of the officers and members of the Lundy's Lane Historical Society, I naturally felt it to be my duty to compliment them upon their work, to congratulate them on the success of their efforts, and to defend them from the only hostile criticism that I knew of being directed against them.
I spoke as follows in concluding my address, as appears in the newspaper report:   It was well, the speaker said, that they should commemorate the  crowning victory, which meant that he could that day wear the maple  leaf, could be a Canadian.
He was aware of one peripatetic philosopher  who had said that the noble gentlemen of Lundy's Lane Historical  Society, in putting up a monument to Canadians alone, were doing  nothing but displaying the signs of an unslaked hatred.
He would  say that to show themselves afraid to honour the memory of their  forefathers would be to make an exhibition of contemptible cowardice.
Lieut.-Colonel Denison then argued that every great nation which has  ever existed has shown itself ready to acknowledge the deeds of those  who had fought for it, and he cited Assyria, Egypt, Greece, and Rome  in ancient history, and Switzerland in modern times, in proof of  this assertion.
The erection of such monuments, he said, taught the  youth of the land to venerate the memory of the past, and encouraged  that sentiment of nationality which was throbbing now so strongly  in Canada.
(Applause.)
The past ten years have witnessed a great  improvement in that respect, he said.
The flag can be seen flying  everywhere, the maple leaf is worn, and Canadian poets celebrate in  verse the finest passages of our history.
The speaker concluded by  expressing the thanks of all to the Government for deciding to erect  monuments to commemorate Canadian battlefields.
He was glad that the  first had been erected on this sacred frontier; that at Chrysler's  Farm would mark the spot of a great victory, and he was glad for the  thought of sympathy with their French-Canadian brothers which had  led to the commemoration of the brilliant victory of Chateauguay,  where, against the greatest odds of the war, 500 French-Canadians had  defeated 5,000 Americans.
Where France's sons on British soil     Fought for their English king.
They should never forget that they owed a sacred duty to the men who  fought and died for the independence of their country.
(Applause.)
The Historical Society objected strenuously to a proposed inscription for the monument, and stopped its being engraved, and asked me to urge upon the Government to put something different.
This was done, and I was asked by the Minister to draft one.
It was accepted, and now stands upon the monument as follows:   Erected by the Canadian Parliament in honour of the victory gained by  the British and Canadian forces on this field on the 25th July, 1814,  and in grateful remembrance of the brave men who died on that day  fighting for the unity of the Empire.
1895  My speech was printed in the Toronto papers at some length, and some of Mr. Smith's friends censured me for having defended the Lundy's Lane Society from his attacks.
A week or two later I was amused at receiving a visit from the Rev.
Canon Bull, the President of the Lundy's Lane Society, who came across the Lake to see me, to lay before me a matter which had come before the Society, and of which after discussion they felt I should be made aware.
I have mentioned above Mr. Goldwin Smith's offer made through Mr. Howland to subscribe for the monument provided he could write the inscription.
This offer and its refusal the Society had kept strictly private, so that I was quite ignorant of it, and made my address in entire innocence of any knowledge in reference to it.
Mr. Smith apparently jumped to the conclusion that I had been told of this offer, and that my comments had been caused by it.
He wrote to Mr. Howland and asked him to put the matter right, and enclosed him a draft of a memo, which he wished Mr. Howland to send to the Society.
Mr. Howland very innocently sent Mr. Smith's letter, his draft memo., and his own comments to the President of the Society, Rev.
As soon as the correspondence was read, my old friend Mr. Wm.
Kirby, author of _Le Chien d'Or_, said, "Col. Denison knew nothing of that offer, but Mr. Smith did make an attack in his lecture on 'Jingoism,' and Col. Denison had answered him in his lecture on 'National Spirit' which was published in the _Empire_ in 1891, and his remarks on that point at the unveiling were on the same lines."
The Society refused to act on Mr. Howland's and Mr. Smith's suggestion, but decided that Canon Bull should come over to Toronto and lay the whole matter before me.
I thanked Canon Bull and asked him to thank the Society, and the next day wrote to him, and asked him if I might have a copy of the letters.
He wrote to me promptly, saying I might as well have the originals and enclosed them.
I have them now.
While Mr. Goldwin Smith was working so earnestly against the interests of the Empire, and while many were leaning towards Commercial Union, and some even ready to go farther and favour annexation, Mr. (afterwards Sir) Oliver Mowat, then Premier of Ontario, saw the danger of the way in which matters were drifting.
I often discussed the subject with him, and knew that he was a thorough loyalist, and a true Canadian and Imperialist.
He often spoke despondingly to me as to what the ultimate outcome might be, for, of course, the majority of the men who at the time favoured Commercial Union were among his supporters, and he would therefore hear more from that side than I would.
In spite of his uneasiness, however, he was staunchly loyal.
Mr. Biggar, his biographer, relates that just before the Inter-Provincial Conference in October, 1887, an active Liberal politician, referring to his opposition to Commercial Union, said to Mr. Mowat in the drawing-room of his house on St. George Street, "If you take that position, sir, you won't have four per cent.
of the party with you."
To which the reply came with unusual warmth and sharpness, "I cannot help it, if I haven't one per cent.
I won't support a policy that will allow the Americans to have any--even the smallest--voice in the making of our laws."
On the evening of the 18th February, 1891, in the election then coming on, Mr. Mowat spoke at a meeting in the Horticultural Pavilion, Toronto, and again his strong loyalty spoke out.
He said among other things, "For myself I am a true Briton.
I love the old land dearly.
I am glad that I was born a British subject; a British subject I have lived for three score years and something more.
I hope to live and die a British subject.
I trust and hope that my children and my grand-children who have also been born British subjects will live their lives as British subjects, and as British subjects die."
Sir Oliver Mowat's clear and outspoken loyalty prevented the Liberals from being defeated in Ontario by a very much greater majority than they were.
During the summer of 1891, however, the annexation movement assumed a still more active form.
Mr. Goldwin Smith was doing his utmost to stir up the feeling.
Solomon White, who had been a Conservative, and was a member of the Ontario Legislature, induced a public meeting in Windsor, where he lived, to pass a resolution in favour of annexation.
Encouraged by this, Mr. White arranged for a meeting in Woodstock in Mr. Mowat's own constituency of South Oxford, in the hope of carrying a resolution there to the same effect.
He wrote:   With reference to our conversation this morning, I desire to reiterate  my strong opinion that it would not be good policy for the friends  of British connection and the old flag to stay away from Mr. Solomon  White's meeting at Woodstock to-morrow.
By doing so and not voting at  the meeting they would enable annexationists to carry a resolution  in favour of their views, and to trumpet it throughout the Dominion  and elsewhere as the sentiment of the community as a whole.
If in  the loyal town of Woodstock, thriving beyond most if not all the  other towns of Ontario, the capital of the banner county of Canadian  Liberalism, formerly represented by that great champion of both  British connection and Liberal principles, the Hon.
George Brown,  and noted heretofore for its fidelity at once to the old flag and  to the Liberal views, if in such a place a resolution were carried  at a public meeting to which all had been invited, no subsequent  explanation as to the thinness of the attendance or as to the  contemptuous absence of opponents would, outside of Oxford, have any  weight.
There are in most counties a few annexationists--in some counties  more than in others; but the aggregate number in the Dominion I am  sure is very small as compared with the aggregate population.
The  great majority of our people, I believe and trust, are not prepared  to hand over this great Dominion to a foreign nation for any present  commercial consideration which may be proposed.
We love our Sovereign,  and we are proud of our status as British subjects.
The Imperial  authorities have refused nothing in the way of self-government which  our representatives have asked for.
Our complaints are against  parliaments and governments which acquired their power from our own  people.
To the United States and its people we are all most friendly.
We recognise the advantages which would go to both them and us from  extended trade relations, and we are willing to go as far in that  direction as shall not involve, now or in the future, political union;  but there Canadians of every party have hitherto drawn the line.
The meeting passed by twelve to one the following resolution:   That the people of Oxford of all parties are deeply attached to their  beloved Sovereign, the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland; that they  proudly recognise the whole British Empire as their country, and  rejoice that Canada is part of that Empire; that Canadians have the  most friendly feelings toward the people of the United States, and  desire the extension of their trade relations with them; that while  differing among themselves as to the extent of the reciprocity to  be desired or agreed to, we repudiate any suggestion that in order  to accomplish this object Canadians should change their allegiance  or consent to the surrender of the Dominion to any foreign Power by  annexation, political union, or otherwise.
Sir Oliver Mowat's biographer states that Sir Oliver had determined in case a pro-annexation resolution should be carried at this meeting, to resign his seat for North Oxford, and appeal again to the constituency on the straight issue of British Connection _v._ Annexation.
The morning Sir Oliver's letter appeared in the papers and we knew what had happened at Woodstock, I went up to his house and congratulated him warmly, and thanked him earnestly for his wise and patriotic action.
I knew that as the leader of the Liberal party in Ontario he had delivered a death-blow to the annexation movement.
I told him so.
I said to him, "You had control of the switch and you have turned it so that the party will be turned towards loyalty and away from annexation.
And when the future historian writes the history of our country, he will not understand his business if he does not point out clearly the far-reaching effect of your action in this matter."
Sir Oliver seemed to think that I overrated the matter, but he told me that he had sent his secretary, Mr. Bastedo, to Woodstock to see his leading supporters, and to do what he could to help Dr. McKay to secure control of the meeting.
Many years have elapsed, and I still hold the opinion I expressed to Sir Oliver that morning, and I feel that Canada should never forget what she owes to Sir Oliver Mowat, and that his name should always be cherished in the memories of our people.
This was followed on the 12th December, 1891, by an open letter to the Hon.
A. Mackenzie which was published as a sort of manifesto to the Liberal party, in which he made an exhaustive argument along the same lines.
In the early part of 1892 Mr. Elgin Myers, County Attorney of Dufferin, was writing and speaking openly and strongly in favour of annexation, and on being remonstrated with by the Government, said he had the right of free speech, and would persist.
Sir Oliver dismissed him from office.
This was another strong lesson, and was heartily approved by the people generally.
About the same time and for the same cause E. A. Macdonald was dismissed by the Dominion Government from the Militia, in which he held the rank of Lieutenant in the 12th York Rangers.
On the 16th July, 1892, about two months after Elgin Myers' dismissal, a great meeting of loyal Canadians was held at Niagara-on-the-Lake, the first capital of the Province, to celebrate the one hundredth anniversary of the establishment of the Province of Upper Canada by Lt.-Governor Simcoe, who issued his first proclamation on July 16th, 1792, at Kingston.
The Lt.-Governor, Sir George Kirkpatrick, made the first speech, and gave a historical sketch of the history of the Province.
Sir Oliver Mowat followed him, and made a very loyal and effective speech.
He commenced by saying:   At this great gathering of Reformers and Conservatives in which both  are equally active, I may be permitted to express at the outset a  hope that there will be no attempt in any quarter to make party  capital out of this historic event, or out of anything which may be  said or left unsaid either in my own case or that of any other of  the speakers.
As the Dominion grows in population and wealth,  changes are inevitable and must be faced.
What are they to be?
Some  of you hope for Imperial Federation.
Failing that, what then?
Shall  we give away our great country to the United States as some--I hope  not many--are saying just now?
(Cries of "Never.")
Or when the time  comes for some important change, shall we go for the only other  alternative, the creation of Canada into an independent nation?
I  believe that the great mass of our people would prefer independence to  political union with any other people.
And so would I.
As a Canadian  I am not willing that Canada should cease to be.
Fellow Canadians,  are you?
(Cries of "No.")
I am not willing that Canada should commit  national suicide.
(Cries of "No.")
I am not willing that  Canada should be absorbed into the United States.
(Cries  of "No.")
I am not willing that both our British connection and  our hope of a Canadian nationality shall be for ever destroyed.
Annexation necessarily means all that.
It means, too, the  abolition of all that is to us preferable in Canadian character and  institutions as contrasted with what in these respects our neighbours  prefer.
But I don't want to belong to them.
I don't want to  give up my allegiance on their account or for any advantage they may  offer.
I cannot bring myself to forget the hatred which so many  of our neighbours cherish towards the nation we love and to which we  are proud to belong.
I cannot forget the influence which that hatred  exerts in their public affairs.
I don't want to belong to a nation  in which both political parties have for party purposes to vie with  one another in exhibiting this hatred.
I don't want to belong to a  nation in which a suspicion that a politician has a friendly feeling  towards the great nation which gave him birth is enough to ensure his  defeat at the polls.
No, I do not want annexation.
I prefer  the ills I suffer to the ills that annexation would involve.
I love  my nation, the nation of our fathers, and shall not willingly join  any nation which hates her.
I love Canada, and I want to perform my  part, whatever it may be, in maintaining her existence as a distinct  political or national organisation.
I believe this to be on the whole  and in the long run the best thing for Canadians and the best thing  for the whole American continent.
I hope that when another century  has been added to the age of Canada, it may still be Canada, and that  its second century shall, like its first, be celebrated by Canadians  unabsorbed, numerous, prosperous, powerful, and at peace.
For myself I  should prefer to die in that hope than to die President of the United  States.
(Cheers and applause.)
Sir Oliver's biographer, C. R. W. Biggar, says of this speech:   Quoted and discussed by almost every newspaper in Canada from Halifax  to Vancouver, and also by the leading journals of Britain and the  United States, Sir Oliver Mowat's speech at the Niagara Centennial  Celebration sounded the death-knell of the annexation movement in  Ontario.
While Sir Oliver was speaking I was sitting close behind him, next to Mr. Wm.
Kirby, who was a staunch loyalist and keen Imperialist.
He was delighted and whispered to me, "Mr. Mowat has stolen your thunder," and again, "He is making your speech."
I replied, "Yes, there will not be any need for me to say much now."
And when I was called upon to speak after him I made a speech strongly supporting him but very brief, feeling, as I did, that he had done all that was necessary in that line.
He was always impressed with the feeling of hostility in the United States.
As I had been speaking upon that subject for years in unmistakable language, and was often abused for my outspoken comments, I was delighted on one occasion some years before at a Board of Trade banquet in the Horticultural Pavilion, Toronto, to hear him say positively "that the United States was a hostile nation."
Afterwards in the cloak room I congratulated him warmly upon his speech, and thanked him for speaking so plainly about the hostility of the United States.
Sir John A. Macdonald was standing by, and he turned playfully towards Mr. Mowat, and, shaking him by the shoulders, said, "Yes, Denison, did he not do well, the little tyrant?"
This was in reference to the opposition papers having sometimes called him "the little tyrant."
Mr. Mowat seemed highly amused, and I was much impressed by the evident kindly, almost affectionate, personal feeling between the two rival statesmen.
The decided position taken by Mr. Mowat certainly had an immense influence upon the Liberal party, and in this he was ably seconded by the Hon.
G. W. Ross, who on many occasions sounded a clear note in favour of British connection and Imperial consolidation.
Sir Leonard Tilley was one of the Fathers of Confederation, and at the time Lieutenant-Governor of New Brunswick.
A meeting of the Council of the League in Canada was held on the 18th September, 1891, Sir Leonard Tilley, President, in the chair, when after careful discussion they passed a resolution asking the League in England to help the Canadian Government to secure the denunciation of the German and Belgian treaties, and a second one urging once more the importance of a preferential trade arrangement between the Mother Country and the Colonies.
On the 30th of the same month, both Houses of the Canadian Parliament passed unanimously an address to the Imperial Government, asking them to denounce the German and Belgian treaties which prevented preferential trade arrangements between the various parts of the British Empire.
The Seventh Annual General Meeting of the League in Canada was held in the Tower Room, House of Commons, Ottawa, on the 1st March, 1892, Mr. Alexander McNeill in the chair.
A still further advance in the policy of the Canadian League was made in a resolution moved by Lt.-Col. W. Hamilton Merritt and carried as follows:   That in the event of preferential inter Imperial trade relations being  adopted in the British Empire, it is the opinion of this League that  Canada will be found ready and willing to bear her share in a just and  reasonable proportion of Imperial responsibilities.
On the 28th April, 1892, Mr. McNeill moved in the House of Commons:   That if and when the Parliament of Great Britain and Ireland admits  Canadian products to the markets of the United Kingdom upon more  favourable terms than it accords to the products of foreign countries,  the Parliament of Canada will be prepared to accord corresponding  advantages by a substantial reduction in the duties it imposes upon  British manufactured goods.
This was carried by ninety-eight votes to sixty-four.
All this was very gratifying to our League, and proved to us that the campaign we had been waging in Canada for nearly five years had convinced the majority of the people of the soundness of our policy.
We had our Parliament with us both on the question of the German and Belgian treaties and preferential tariffs.
In Great Britain, however, our progress had been slow; with the exception of Sir Howard Vincent no prominent British politician had accepted the principle of preferential tariffs.
Lord Salisbury had spoken tentatively at the Guildhall on the 9th November, 1890, and at Hastings on the 18th May, 1892, but he was, while in a sense favourable, very cautious in his remarks, as he felt public opinion in Great Britain was quite averse to any such policy on account of their obstinate adherence to the principle of Free Trade.
The majority of the Imperial Federation League in England were not at all favourable to the views of the Canadian League, and the Journal of the League showed its bias in all its articles on the subject, while Lord Knutsford on behalf of the Imperial Government in his dispatch on the 2nd April, 1892, in answer to the joint address of the Canadian Houses of Parliament declared, that for reasons given, "Her Majesty's Government have felt themselves unable to advise Her Majesty to comply with the prayer of the address which you have transmitted for submission to Her Majesty."
The Eighth Annual General Meeting of the League in Canada was held in Montreal on the 13th February, 1893, Mr. Alexander McNeill, Vice-President, in the chair, and a resolution was carried, asking the Government to request the Imperial Government to summon an Imperial Conference.
Sir Leonard Tilley wrote to the meeting asking to be relieved of the duties of President, and advising the election of Mr. Alexander McNeill in his place.
In my absence, through Mr. McNeill's efforts, I was elected President of the League.
I accepted the position, and on examination of its affairs I found that from a business point of view it was in a very bad condition.
The work of the Secretary was behindhand, the League was without funds and considerably in debt.
I soon succeeded in placing it in a much better position.
A large amount of arrears of fees was collected, and with the assistance of Mr. Herbert Mason and the late C. J. Campbell we soon secured subscriptions from a number of friends of the cause, whose names I feel should be recorded as they aided the movement for many years.
The list of subscribers was as follows: George T. Denison, J. Herbert Mason, George Gooderham, A. R. Creelman, John T. Small, A.
B. Lee, D'Alton McCarthy, Sir Sandford Fleming, Sir Frank Smith, Alfred Gooderham, T. G. Blackstock, D. R. Wilkie, Larratt W. Smith, E. B. Osler, A. M. Cosby, George R. R. Cockburn, Hugh Blain, Albert E. Gooderham, W. G. Gooderham, and W. H. Beatty.
The debts were paid, and a balance on hand and the future expenses for some years secured.
A new secretary was appointed, and everything was in good working order.
I had barely succeeded in this when I received from the secretary of the League in England a communication marked "Strictly private and confidential," informing me that there was a proposal to dissolve the League, and close its business.
I was much astonished and alarmed at this information, and much embarrassed by the strict secrecy imposed on me, but a day or two afterwards I found by the cable dispatches in the Toronto papers that the matter had come before the Council in England and that the motion had been adjourned for six months.
I concluded that the six months' hoist meant the end of it.
So I preserved the strict request for secrecy which had been made to me.
I had before written privately in reply to the Secretary, Mr. A. H. Loring, protesting against the proposition to dissolve the League.
And I happened to mention that I personally would feel inclined to keep up the struggle.
I thought the postponement had settled the matter, but as Mr. John T. Small, the Hon.
Treasurer, was going to England that summer, and as he was a member of the Executive Committee of the League in England and entitled to know what was being done, I urged him very particularly to go to the head office in London, and inquire carefully as what was going on.
When he returned he told me that he had twice tried to see Mr. Loring but failed, that he had asked for his address, which the clerk said he could not give him as he was away on his holidays, and Mr. Small was assured by the clerk that there was nothing going on, and that there was no information that he knew of to give him.
All this lulled me into a feeling of security.
Suddenly on 25th November, 1893, the news came by cable to the Press that on the previous day a meeting had been held in London, and that the League had been dissolved.
The meeting was called by a circular dated 17th November, so that there was no possibility for the Canadian members of the Council in England to have attended, even if notices had been sent to them, which was not done.
In the Journal for the 1st December, 1893 (the last issue of that publication), it is stated that discussion had been taking place in the meetings of the Executive Committee during the previous six months, to decide upon the course of action to be adopted by the League in the immediate future; and it shows that a special committee had been appointed to consider the matter.
The report of this committee was signed by the Rt.
This committee reported "a recommendation, that the operations of the League should be brought to a close."
"This report was discussed at several meetings of the Executive Committee, and alternative proposals were carefully considered during the autumn," and on the 24th November, 1893, the report was adopted by a vote of 18 to 17, Mr. Loring saying he had been assured that the Canadian League would continue as heretofore.
In spite of all these discussions mentioned, Mr. Small was assured there was nothing going on, and the Canadian League were kept in ignorance of the movement until it was accomplished.
This dissolution of the League at a council meeting to which none of the thirty-five Canadian members representing the Canadian Branch were either invited or notified, caused a considerable feeling of dissatisfaction among our members, and was a severe and disheartening blow to all friends of the cause in Canada, the concealment and secrecy of the whole movement being very unsatisfactory to everyone.
I called a meeting of our Executive Committee at once for the 27th November when the matter was considered.
A resolution was moved and unanimously carried that the Secretary should notify the Secretary of the Imperial Federation League to stop the paper at the end of this year, and if the journal should be continued that they should communicate direct with the Canadian subscribers.
That the Executive Committee having had brought to its notice  telegrams from England published during the past week in the daily  papers stating that the Council of the League in England contemplated  carrying resolutions tending towards its dissolution, would ask (as it  conceives it has the right to do) to be advised at once of any steps  proposed to be taken in that direction.
The Canadian Branch of the League was formed at a meeting held in  Montreal on the 9th May, 1885.
At that meeting the resolutions passed  at the Conference held in London on the 29th July, 1884, and at the  inaugural meeting of the League held on the 18th November, 1884, were  accepted, and a resolution was then carried forming a Canadian Branch  of the League, to be called the Imperial Federation League in Canada.
Among the resolutions of the League in England so accepted were the  following:--   (1) That the object of the League be to secure by federation the  permanent unity of the Empire.
(2) That British subjects throughout the Empire be invited to become  members and to form and organise branches of the League which may  place their representatives on the general committee.
Canada then was, and is to-day, face to face with momentous  questions involving its whole political future.
The Earl of Rosebery  then and until recently President of the League, in a speech at  Edinburgh on the 31st October, 1888, quoted from a speech delivered in  the American Senate by Senator Sherman these words:   "I am anxious to bring about a public policy that will make more  intimate our relations with the Dominion of Canada.
Anything that  will tend to the union of Canada with the United States will meet with  my most hearty support.
I want Canada to be part of the United States.
Within ten years from this time (and I ask your particular attention  to this), within ten years from this time the Dominion of Canada will,  in my judgment, be represented either in the Imperial Parliament of  Great Britain, or in the Congress of the United States."
Such language  he thought worthy of attention, and then Lord Rosebery went on to say:  "My plan is this: to endeavour so to influence public opinion at home  and in the Colonies that there shall come an imperious demand from the  people of this country, both at home and abroad, that this federation  should be brought about."
To bring about a solution of the questions above indicated on the  lines laid down by Lord Rosebery has been, since the formation of the  Canadian Branch and up to this time, its constant and anxious care,  and many of its members have, at great personal sacrifice, devoted  themselves to securing the permanent unity of the Empire, with Canada  as an integral part.
Much work has been done, but much more remains to be done.
The most  enthusiastic of our members would be unable to say that the objects of  the League have been accomplished, or that the question above referred  to especially affecting Canada has as yet been solved.
The dissolution of the League in England would therefore be nothing  less than the desertion of the Canadian Branch at a critical period  in its history, and would further appear necessarily to involve the  destruction of the Leagues branches both in Canada and elsewhere.
To  those at least who are unfriendly to our aims, it will seem that the  great cause, of which this branch may without exaggeration be said to  be the representative in Canada, has received a heavy blow indeed at  the hands of its friends.
Under these circumstances the Council of the League in England  will, this committee is convinced, appreciate the necessity and  propriety of consulting the Canadian Branch of the League, and of duly  notifying the members resident in Canada, of the Executive Committee  and of the Council of the League in England, before taking any such  step as that above referred to, a step to which this committee has  seen the first and only reference in the public Press.
Not long afterwards we learned that a small faction, principally those who had managed to destroy the League, had formed a new organisation, had taken over the office, appropriated the records, lists of members, subscription list, &c., and adopted the same trade mark or title cover used for pamphlets.
They also assumed the name "Imperial Federation (Defence) Committee," and began circulating literature, pamphlets, fly-sheets, &c., all pointing out the shortcomings of the Colonies, and demanding cash contributions to the Army and Navy.
This was done in a spirit that aroused a good deal of hostile feeling in Canada, and did much more harm than good to the cause they seemed to advocate.
Had they desired to destroy the movement in Canada, they could not have taken more effective steps to secure that result.
This intrigue has been the most puzzling circumstance connected with the history of the Imperial Federation movement.
I have never been able, even after the most careful inquiry, to reach with confidence the real cause of such peculiar conduct.
At one time I thought that as Lord Rosebery had become Premier the existence of the League might have become embarrassing to him, and that he had been in favour of doing away with it, but Dr. Parkin assured me that this could not be, as Lord Rosebery referred to the question some years after when Dr. Parkin was his guest at Mentmore, and asked him why the League was dissolved, and Lord Rosebery said that he regretted its dissolution very much and could never understand it.
My own impression, although it is, of course, not capable of proof, has always been that a few free traders on the committee were alarmed at the progress the Canadian members were making in spreading views in favour of preferential tariffs, and in reference to which Sir Charles Tupper had been rather aggressive.
The destruction of the League would have been useless unless steps were taken to prevent its revival, and to destroy, if possible, the League in Canada.
Hence the adoption of the name, address, trade mark, etc., under which to flood Canada with publications tending to arouse great hostility among our people.
This was the condition in which I found affairs only about ten months after I had been elected President.
The outlook was most discouraging, and caused a great deal of anxious discussion among the stalwarts in Toronto.
We decided to summon a meeting of our most influential men to consider the situation, and decide whether we also should dissolve, or whether we would continue the struggle.
The meeting was held on the 3rd January, 1894, and after full discussion it was decided to fight on, and with the assistance of Sir John Lubbock, who had sent a communication to us asking us to co-operate with him, to endeavour to resuscitate the League in England.
The ninth annual meeting of the Imperial Federation League in Canada was held in the Parliament Buildings, Ottawa, on the 29th May, 1894, and in the notices of motion printed in the circular calling the meeting was one by Lt.-Col. Wm.
And another to the same effect by Rev.
Principal George M. Grant:   Resolved, that this League is of opinion that as a first step towards  arriving at a system of preferential trade within the Empire, the  Government of Canada should lower the Customs duties now imposed on  goods manufactured in and imported from Great Britain.
These notices exactly foreshadowed the policy adopted by Sir Wilfrid Laurier's Government in 1897.
Another resolution was carried to the effect that a delegation should be elected by the Executive Committee to confer personally with the City of London Branch and similar organisations, and agree upon a common course of future action.
Secretary of the League in Canada, John T. Small, Esq., Hon.
Messrs. Clark, Small, and Weldon were unable to act, and Sir Charles Tupper, then High Commissioner, Lord Strathcona, and Lt.-Col. Septimus Denison, Secretary and Treasurer of the London Ontario Branch, were added to the delegation.
This was the turning point of the movement, and led to the organisation of the British Empire League and the continuance of the struggle for Imperial consolidation.
The account of this mission, its work in England, and the subsequent proceedings of the new League, and the progress of the movement for Imperial Unity during the succeeding years, will be dealt with in the following chapters.
I breakfasted with him on the 13th, when we thoroughly discussed the whole question.
I pressed upon him the urgent need there was that we should have a head office in England, and how important the movement was in order to spread and maintain the Imperial sentiment in Canada.
He was most sympathetic and friendly, and said that if it would be convenient for us he would gather a number of men favourable to the idea to meet us at his house a week later, on the 20th July.
I wrote to the members of the delegation, and gathered them the day before at Lord Strathcona's rooms on Dover Street, and secured the attendance of Sir Charles Tupper, who was then High Commissioner for Canada, and also a member of our League, and we added him to the committee.
We discussed our policy at considerable length, and arranged to meet at Sir John Lubbock's in St. James's Square the following morning at eleven a.m.
I happened to be breakfasting at the United Service Club that morning with Lord Roberts and General Nicholson, and Lord Roberts hearing that I was going to Sir John Lubbock's, said that he had been asked to attend the meeting, but had not intended to go.
I prevailed upon him to accompany me.
Sir John Lubbock had a number of gentlemen to meet us, among whom were Sir Westby Percival, Agent-General for New Zealand, the Hon.
T. A. Brassey, Messrs. C. Freeman Murray, W. Culver James, W. H. Daw, W. Becket Hill, Ralph Young, H. W. Marcus, and others.
Sir John Lubbock was in the chair and Mr. Freeman Murray was secretary.
As chairman of our deputation, I put our case before the meeting, following the lines agreed upon at the conference at Lord Strathcona's rooms the day before.
I spoke for about forty minutes, and naturally urged very strongly the importance of preferential trading throughout the Empire, as a practical means of securing a permanent unity, and I insisted that we should make the denunciation of the German-Belgian Treaties one of the definite objects of the League.
The City of London Branch had prepared a programme of a suggested constitution, which contained nearly all the clauses afterwards agreed upon as the constitution of the British Empire League.
Our Canadian delegation accepted all their suggestions, but we insisted on a clause referring to the German and Belgian Treaties.
Our English friends were evidently afraid of the bogey of Free Trade, and seemed to think that any expressed intention of doing away with the German and Belgian Treaties would prevent many free traders from joining the League.
I urged our view strongly, and was ably assisted by speeches from Sir Charles Tupper, Lord Strathcona, and Sir Westby Percival.
Our English friends still held out against us.
At last I said that we had agreed with all they had advocated, had accepted all their suggestions, but that when we asked what we considered the most important and necessary point of all, the denunciation of the German and Belgian Treaties, we were met with unyielding opposition, that there was no object in continuing the discussion, and we would go home and report to our League that, even among our best friends, we could not get any support towards relieving us of restrictions that should never have been placed upon us.
Mr. Becket Hill seeing the possibility of the meeting proving abortive, suggested an adjournment for a week.
Mr. Herbert Daw immediately rose, and in a few vigorous sentences changed the tone.
He said that the Canadians had agreed with them in everything, and that when they urged a very reasonable request they were not listened to.
He said that was an unwise course to take, and urged that an attempt should be made to meet our views.
Sir John Lubbock then said: "Perhaps I can draw up a clause which will meet the wishes of our Canadian friends," and he wrote out the following clause:   To consider how far it may be possible to modify any laws or treaties  which impede freedom of action in the making of reciprocal trade  arrangements between the United Kingdom and the colonies, or between  any two or more British Colonies or possessions.
I said at once that we would accept that clause, provided it was understood that we of the Canadian Branch should have the right to agitate for that which we thought was the best, and the only way, probably, of unifying the empire.
We claimed we were to have the right to work for the denunciation of the treaties with the view of securing preferential tariffs around the Empire, and that in so doing we were not to be considered as violating the constitution of the League, although the central council was not to be responsible for the views of the Canadian Branch.
That settled the matter at once, and the League was formed.
Difficulty was found in deciding upon a name.
We wished to retain the old name, but the arguments in favour of a change were so great that we yielded to the wishes of our English brethren.
A number of names were suggested, most of them long and explanatory, when Mr. James L. Hughes suggested that as the object was the maintenance of the British Empire why not call the League simply "The British Empire League."
This appealed to all, and it was at once adopted, so that Mr. Hughes was the godfather of the League.
It was then arranged that a meeting of the old City of London branch of the Imperial Federation League should be called at the London Chamber of Commerce.
It was held on the 26th July, when several of us addressed the meeting, and an organising committee was formed for undertaking the work of the reconstruction of the League.
Addressing this meeting at some length, I endeavoured to show the importance of settling the North-West, as well as other portions of Canada, with a population of British people if possible, who would grow grain to supply the wants of the mother country.
I stated that a preferential tariff against the United States would keep our people in Canada, and would cause settlers from Great Britain to make their homes in that country; and that in a very little time the North-West Territories would be occupied by a large population of loyal people, who would be devoted to the Empire, and would be able to supply all the bread-stuffs that England would require.
In order to impress that upon the audience, I drew their attention to the fact that if England was engaged in a war with continental countries, say, for instance, Russia and France, it would cut off the supply of wheat from the former country; and that if hostilities were also to break out between the United States and England, it would confine the mother country's wheat supply to India, Australia, and Canada; that the distance was so great that it would take an enormous naval force to keep the sea routes open, and that these would be constantly liable to attack and interruption unless England had absolute command of the sea.
I then went on to say that I was aware that there was a strong feeling in England that there was no possibility of a war with the United States, but warned the meeting that they must not rely upon that belief, and I quoted several facts to prove my view.
Within eighteen months the Venezuelan Message of President Cleveland, followed as it was by the warlike approving messages to Mr. Cleveland from 42 out of the 45 Governors of States, proved how easily trouble might arise.
Mr. James L. Hughes also addressed this meeting, and we were strongly supported by a member of the Fair Trade League, who used some powerful arguments in favour of some steps being taken to improve the position of the "Food Supply."
He was answered by Mr. Harold Cox, Secretary of the Cobden Club, who said that my proposition was one that would abolish Free Trade, and substitute Protection for it.
In spite of his appeal to the intense prejudice of the British people, at that time in favour of Free Trade, the idea of an Imperial Preferential tariff seemed to have considerable weight upon those who heard it expounded.
Lord Tennyson was present at the meeting and spoke to me afterwards, approving of much of my speech, but regretting I had spoken so freely about the United States.
I replied that the very fact of his criticism was a strong proof of the necessity for my speaking out, and told him I would send him some publications which would enable him the better to appreciate our view.
This I did.
He has been a strong supporter of the British Empire League and acted on the Executive Committee from the first.
I addressed a large meeting at Hawick, Scotland, on the 17th August, 1894, and for the first time in Scotland advocated our Canadian policy.
My friend Charles John Wilson organised the meeting.
I spoke in much the same strain as in London.
Although my remarks were well received it was evident that free trade opinion was paramount, and that I did not have any direct support in the meeting.
One member of the Town Council told me at the close that, while they were all free traders, yet I had given them food for thought for some time.
At the Congress of Chambers of Commerce of the Empire held in London in July, 1906, my friend Mr. Charles John Wilson, who spoke at my meeting in Hawick in 1894, was a representative of the South of Scotland Chamber of Commerce, and made a powerful speech in favour of the Canadian resolution which endorsed Mr. Chamberlain's policy of preferential tariff, and his Chamber of Commerce voted for it.
The organising committee appointed at the London meeting took a considerable time in arranging the details.
Lord Avebury told me that he had considerable difficulty in getting a prominent outstanding man as President, and that the negotiations took up a great deal of time.
He wished to secure the Duke of Devonshire, and he being very busy, could not give much time, and only agreed at length to take the position on the understanding that Sir Robert Herbert who, for many years had been the Permanent Under Secretary for the Colonies, and was about to be superannuated, should undertake to act as chairman of the Executive Committee and attend to the management of the League.
When all was arranged, a large meeting was held at the Mansion House on the 27th January, 1896, the Lord Mayor in the chair, and then the British Empire League was formally inaugurated, the constitution adopted, and a resolution, moved by Lord Avebury, carried:   That the attention of our fellow-countrymen throughout the Empire is  invited to the recent establishment of the British Empire League, and  their support by membership and subscription is strongly recommended.
It may be mentioned that when our deputation reported to the League in Canada the arrangements we had agreed to, it was suggested that an addition should be made to the constitution by the insertion of what is now the second clause of it.
"It shall be the primary object of the League to secure the permanent unity of the Empire."
This, of course, had been well understood, but the Canadian League desired it to be placed in the constitution in formal terms.
The request was made to the committee in England, and it was at once acceded to.
A special general meeting of the Imperial Federation League in Canada was held in the Tower Room, House of Commons, Ottawa, on the 4th March, 1896, to consider the annual report of the Executive Committee, and the recommendation therein contained, that the League should change its name to that of the British Empire League in Canada, and affiliate with the British Empire League.
As President of the League I occupied the chair.

Secretary), and others.
I moved the adoption of the annual report, which contained a copy of the constitution of the British Empire League, and recommended that the Canadian League be affiliated with that body.
As to the question of changing the name of the League, I said:   That the Canadian delegation had urged the retention of the name  Imperial Federation League, but the arguments in favour of the  change were so great that we felt we had to yield to the wishes  of our English brethren.
The word Federation was objected to by  some, and there is no doubt that to attempt to prepare a fixed and  written constitution for a federated Empire, with all its divergent  interests, would be a very difficult thing to do.
If a dozen of  the very ablest men in all the Empire were to devote any amount  of time and their greatest energies to prepare a scheme for such a  federation, and succeeded in making one practical and workable under  existing conditions, might not ten or twenty years so change the  conditions as to make a fixed written constitution very embarrassing  and unsuitable?
Such a method is not in accord with the genius of the  British Constitution.
The British Constitution is unwritten; it has  "broadened down from precedent to precedent," always elastic, always  adapting itself to changing conditions.
So should the idea of British  unity be carried out.
Let us work along the lines of least resistance.
The memorial included in the report urges a conference to consider  the trade question.
A conference might arrange some plan to carry out  that one idea; in a year or two another conference could be called to  consider some other point of agreement.
Soon these conferences would  become periodical.
Soon a committee would be appointed to carry out  the wishes of the conferences in the periods between the meetings;  and then you would have an Imperial Council, and Imperial Federation  would have become evolved in accordance with the true genius of the  Anglo-Saxon race.
Let us take one step at a time, and we shall slowly  but surely realise our wishes.
These remarks outlined the policy that the Executive Committee had agreed upon, and foreshadowed much that has since occurred.
Mr. Alexander McNeill seconded the adoption of the report, which was carried unanimously.
Sir Charles Tupper then moved the first resolution:   Whereas the British Empire League has been formally inaugurated in  London with practically the same objects in view as the Imperial  Federation League, this meeting expresses its sympathy and concurrence  therewith, and resolves that hereafter the Imperial Federation League  in Canada shall be a branch of the British Empire League, and shall be  known and described as the British Empire League in Canada.
In his speech he gave a short sketch of the progress of the old League, and pointed out that it was an important fact that this organisation had committed itself to the policy of removing the obstruction to preferential trade with Great Britain which existed through the treaties with Belgium and Germany.
Mr. D'Alton McCarthy seconded the resolution.
He also spoke of the work of the old League which he had founded in Canada, and of which he was the first President.
He said:   That no mistake was made in forming the League, because at that time,  twelve years ago, the feeling was towards independence or annexation.
The League did very much to divert public opinion in the direction in  which it was now running.
As to the treaties between Great Britain and  other countries, he did not look upon them as an obstruction but as  an impediment.
For his part he was prepared to do anything to advance  Canadian trade relations with England at once, without postponing it  until those treaties were terminated by Great Britain.
This last sentence shows that at that time he was contemplating the adoption of the policy of a British Preference, which I believe in the following year, with Principal Grant's assistance, he succeeded in inducing Sir Wilfrid Laurier and his Government to adopt.
The constitution, by-laws and rules for the governance of branches were then adopted, and the work of the old Imperial Federation League in Canada has since been carried on under the name of "The British Empire League in Canada."
I have always felt that this success of our mission to England was most important in its result, or at least that its failure would have been very unfortunate.
The collapse of the Imperial Federation League had disheartened the leading Imperialists very much, and the deputation to England was an effort to overcome what was a very serious set back.
Had we been obliged to come home and report that we could get no one in Great Britain sufficiently interested to work with us, it would necessarily have broken up our organisation in Canada, and the movement in favour of the organisation of the Empire, and a commercial union of its parts, would have been abandoned by the men who had done so much to arouse an Imperial sentiment.
The effect of this would have been widespread.
Our opponents were still at work, and many of the Liberal party were still very lukewarm on the question of Imperial unity.
Our success, on the other hand, encouraged the loyalists, and led the politicians of both sides to believe that the sentiment in favour of the unity of the Empire was an element to be reckoned with.
Sir John Macdonald had made his great appeal to the loyalty of Canada in 1891, and had carried the elections, the ground having been prepared by the work of the League for years before.
The general election was coming on in 1896, and it was most important that the Imperial sentiment should not be considered dead.
After Sir John's death the Conservative party suffered several severe losses in the deaths of Sir John Abbott and Sir John Thompson, and in the revolt of a number of ministers against Sir Mackenzie Bowell, who had been appointed Prime Minister.
The party had been in power for about eighteen years, and was moribund, many barnacles were clinging to it.
He was of the opinion that his party had been in long enough, and that it was time for a change; and he held that the success of the Liberals at that time with their accession to office, and the responsibilities thus created, would at once cause them to drop all their coquetting with the United States, and would naturally lead them to be thoroughly loyal to a country which they themselves were governing.
About the 1st January, 1896, President Cleveland issued his Venezuelan message in reference to a dispute between Great Britain and Venezuela.
It was couched in hostile terms, and was almost insolent in its character.
Among European nations it would have been accepted almost as a declaration of war.
This was approved of by the United States as a whole.
Nearly all the Governors of States (forty-two out of forty-five was, I believe, the proportion) telegraphed messages of approval to President Cleveland, and many of them offered the services of the militia of their States, to be used in an invasion of Canada.
This aroused the feeling of our people in an extraordinary degree, and in all Canada the newspapers sounded a loyal and determined note.
I was anxious about several papers which had opposed us, and had even advocated independence or annexation, but indignant at the absolute injustice of the proposed attack upon Canada they came out more vehemently than any.
The _Norfolk Reformer_ struck a loyal, patriotic, and manly note, while Mr. Daniel McGillicuddy of the _Huron Signal_, who used to attack me whenever he was short of a subject, was perhaps more decided than any.
He said in his paper that he had always been friendly to the United States and always written on their behalf, but when they talked of invading the soil of Canada, they would find they would meet a loyal and determined people who would crowd to the frontier to the strains of "The Maple Leaf Forever" and would die in the last ditch, but would never surrender.
Mr. McGillicuddy had served in the Fenian raid in the Militia, and all his fighting blood was aroused.
This episode of the Venezuela message ended the annexation talk everywhere, and Mr. McGillicuddy has been for years a member of the Council of the British Empire League.
I had but little influence myself in political matters, but I had great confidence in Sir Oliver Mowat and the Hon.
George W. Ross, and among my friends I urged that they should be induced to enter Dominion politics, as their presence among the Liberal leaders would give the people of Ontario a confidence which in 1891 had been much shaken in reference to the loyalty of the Liberal opposition.
I was much pleased to find that before the election in 1896, arrangements were made that Sir Oliver Mowat was to leave the Ontario Premiership, and support Sir Wilfrid Laurier in the Senate.
In the early spring of 1896, while the Conservative Government were still in power, I wrote to Lord Salisbury and told him what I thought would happen, first that the Conservatives would be defeated, and secondly that the Liberals, when they came into power, would be loyal and true to the Empire, and that he need not be uneasy, from an Imperial point of view, on account of the change of Government.
I knew that with Sir Oliver Mowat in the Cabinet everything would be right, and I felt that all the others would stand by the Empire.
In 1897, during the Jubilee celebration in London, I saw Lord Salisbury, and he was much gratified at the action of the Canadian Government in establishing the British Preference, and said that they had been anxious about the attitude of the Liberal party, until Sir Wilfrid Laurier's first speeches in the House after his accession to office.
I laughingly said, "You need not have been anxious, for I wrote telling you it would be all right and not to be uneasy."
His reply was, "Yes, I know you did, but we thought you were too sanguine."
As soon as the new Government were sworn in, we endeavoured to press our views of preferential tariffs upon them, D'Alton McCarthy and Principal George M. Grant exerting themselves on that behalf, and during the autumn of 1896 a deputation of the Cabinet consisting of the Hon.
Fielding, Hon.
Sir Richard Cartwright, and the Hon.
Patterson travelled through the country inquiring of the Boards of Trade and business men as to their views on the question of revision of the tariff.
Our League naturally took advantage of this opportunity to press our views upon the Government, and urged Mr.
Fielding and his colleagues very earnestly to take steps to secure a system of preferential tariffs.
A curious incident occurred on this occasion that is worth recording.
While our deputation were sitting in the Board of Trade room in Toronto waiting our turn to be heard, a manufacturer was pressing the interests of his own business upon the Ministers.
It was amusing to hear him explain how he wanted one duty lowered here, and another raised there, and apparently wanted the tariff system arranged solely for his own benefit.
There was such a narrow, selfish spirit displayed that we listened in amazement that any man should be so callously selfish.
Fielding thought he had a good subject to use against us, so he said to the man, "Suppose we lower the duty say one-third on these articles you make, how would that affect you?"
"It would destroy my business and close my factory."
"Then," said Mr.
Fielding, "here is a deputation from the British Empire League waiting to give their views after you, and I am sure they will want me to give Great Britain a preference."
The man became excited at once, he closed up his papers and in vehement tones said, "If that is what you are going to do, that is right.
I am an Imperial Federationist clear through.
Do that, and I am satisfied."
"But what will you do?"
"It will ruin your business."
"Never mind me," he replied, "I can go into something else, preferential tariffs will build up our Empire and strengthen it, and I will be able to find something to do."
"I am an Imperialist," he said with great emphasis as he went out.
I turned to someone near me and said, "I must find out who that man is, and I will guarantee he has United Empire Loyalist blood in his veins."
He proved to be a Mr. Greey, a grandson of John William Gamble, who was a member of a very distinguished United Empire Loyalist family.
I am sure this incident must have had some influence upon Mr.
Fielding, as an illustration of the deep-seated loyalty and Imperialism of a large element of the Upper Canadian population.
The members of our League were delighted with the action of the Government in the Session of 1897, in establishing a preference in our markets in favour of British goods.
It will be remembered that we had been disappointed in our hope that Lord Salisbury would have denounced the Treaties in 1892, when the thirty years for which they were fixed would expire, but five years more had elapsed and nothing had been done.
I believe the plan adopted by our Government had been suggested by Mr. D'Alton McCarthy, our former President, and in order to get over the difficulty about the German and Belgian Treaties, the preference was not nominally given to Great Britain at all, but was a reduction of duty to all countries which allowed Canadian exports access to their markets on free trade terms.
This of course applied at once to Great Britain and one of the Australian Colonies (New South Wales).
All other nations, including Germany and Belgium, would not get the preference unless they lowered their duties to a level with the duties levied by Great Britain.
The preference was first fixed at one-eighth of the duty just to test the principle.
Shortly after this was announced in our Commons, Kipling, who saw at once the force of it, published his striking poem "Our Lady of the Snows," which emphasised the fact that Canada intended to manage her own affairs:      Daughter am I in my mother's house,     But mistress in mine own.
The gates are mine to open     As the gates are mine to close,     And I set my house in order     Said Our Lady of the Snows.
Another strong point was illustrated in the lines:      Favour to those I favour     But a stumbling block to my foes,     Many there be that hate us,     Said Our Lady of the Snows.
Carry the word to my sisters,     To the Queens of the East and the South,     I have proved faith in the heritage     By more than the word of the mouth.
They that are wise may follow     Ere the world's war trumpet blows,     But I, I am first in the battle,     Said Our Lady of the Snows.
This poem pointed out to Great Britain that Canada had waited long enough for the denunciation of treaties which never should have been made, and which were an absolutely indefensible restriction on the great colonies.
At a meeting of the council of the British Empire League in Canada held in May a week or two after the Annual Meeting in Ottawa, a resolution was passed:   That the President and those members of the Canadian Branch who are  members of the Council of the League in England be hereby appointed  a deputation (with power to add to their number) from the League  in Canada to the League in the United Kingdom; and that they be  instructed to lay before the members of the Parent League the views  of the Canadian Branch on matters of national moment, such as the  organisation of a Royal Naval Reserve in the colonies, and also to  express their opinion that, as a guarantee of the general safety of  the Empire, vigorous steps should at once be taken to provide that  the British food supply should be grown within the Empire.
The deputation consisted of the following: The Hon.
We were delayed for some days by fogs, and did not arrive in Liverpool till after Sir Wilfrid Laurier had left that place.
He had arrived in the old world for the first time of his life, and at once fell into the hands of the Liverpool merchants and business men, at that time generally free traders.
He had not a colleague with him and naturally was affected by the atmosphere in which he found himself, and in his speech at the great banquet given by the British Empire League with the Duke of Devonshire in the chair, he made a few remarks in reference to preferential tariffs for which he was severely criticised at home.
I joined the party at Glasgow two days later, and Sir Wilfrid, who seemed pleased to see me, had a long talk with me between Glasgow and Liverpool on the special train which took the party down.
On the following morning the Liverpool papers had cables from Canada giving an account of the discussion in the Canadian House of Commons over the cabled reports of Sir Wilfrid's speech.
He was attacked vehemently by Alexander McNeill, our champion in the House, on one point of his speech at Liverpool, and Sir Richard Cartwright and his colleagues, in defending Sir Wilfrid, did so on the ground that the reports of what he said could not be taken as correct, and asking the House to withhold comment until the full reports should be received.
This was a desirable course to adopt, for cable despatches have so often conveyed inaccurate impressions.
The real secret of the trouble was that in the busy rush of his work as leader of the opposition, and then as Premier, Sir Wilfrid had not been able really to master the question, but he soon grasped the subject, and his later speeches were very effective.
His reception by the British people was wonderfully favourable, and the impression he made upon them was remarkable.
He stood out from all the other Premiers--and there were eleven in all--and he was everywhere the central and striking figure.
On the 5th July, 1897, a meeting of the British Empire League was held in the Merchant Taylors Hall.
The Duke of Devonshire was in the chair and made an able speech welcoming the Premiers from the colonies.
He was followed by Rt.
R. J. Seddon, Premier of New Zealand, Sir William Whiteway, Premier of Newfoundland, Mr. G. H. Reid, Premier of New South Wales, and Sir Edward Braddon, Premier of Tasmania.
Sir Wilfred Laurier had not been able to attend, and as President of the League in Canada I was called upon to speak.
As to the treaties, I said:   I have come here from Canada to make one or two suggestions.
In the  first place in reference to preferential tariffs, we have shown you  that we wish to give you a preference in our markets.
But treaties interfere with us in the management of our own tariff,  and I wish to emphasise the fact that some steps should be taken to  place us in absolute freedom to give every advantage we wish to our  fellow-countrymen all over the world.
We wish to give that  advantage to our own people, and we do not wish to be forced to give  it to the foreigner.
(Hear, hear.)
Now my last point is this.
In Canada we have viewed with considerable  alarm the fact that the wealthiest and most powerful nation in all  history is at this moment dependent for her daily food for three out  of every four of her population upon two foreign nations, who are, I  am thankful to say, friendly to her, and who, I hope, will always be  friendly, but who, it cannot be denied, might by some possibility be  engaged in war with us at some future time.
These two nations might  then stop your food supply, and that harm to you would spread great  distress among the people of our country.
I have been deputed by the  League in Canada to ask you to look carefully into this question.
If  there is no real danger, relieve our fears; but if you find there is  any danger let me urge upon you as strongly as I can to take some  steps to meet that danger.
Let the method be what it may, great  national granaries, a duty on food, a bounty or what not, but let  something be done.
A special meeting of the Council of the League was held on the 7th July, 1897, to meet the deputation of our League.
In my address I once more dealt with the question of the German and Belgian treaties.
I said, "The Canadian people have now offered, in connection with their desire regarding these treaties, to give what they propose to all nations, but with the express intention of giving an advantage to our own people.
I am deputed to ask you to use what influence you can on the Government and people of this country to give us that full control of our own tariff to which we contend we are entitled."
Lord Salisbury in 1890, although favourable to the idea, was not able to secure the denunciation of the German and Belgian treaties, although I knew from his conversation with me that personally he felt that they should be denounced.
In 1892 Lord Knutsford peremptorily refused a request by Canada to denounce the treaties.
Lord Ripon was not quite so peremptory in 1894-'95 after the Ottawa Conference, but he refused permission to Mr. Rhodes to arrange a discriminating tariff in Matabeleland.
We had been held off for six years, but the action of the Canadian Government brought matters to a head.
During June and July, 1897, in London the most profuse and large-hearted hospitality was shown on every hand to the colonial visitors, and I was fortunate enough to be invited to all the large functions.
I felt the importance of taking every opportunity to press upon the leading men in England the necessity for the denunciation of the treaties, and I knew Sir Wilfrid Laurier could not urge it with the freedom or force that I could.
Consequently in private conversations I talked very freely on the subject, whenever and wherever I had an opportunity.
I found that in meeting friends, almost the first remark would be an approving comment on the friendliness of the Canadian Parliament in giving the British people a preference in the markets of Canada.
My reply always was that it was no more than was right, considering all that Great Britain had done for us.
This was usually followed by the remark that the Government were afraid, from the first impression of the law officers of the Crown, that Great Britain would not be able to accept the favour.
My reply was very confidently, "Oh yes!
you will accept it."
Then the remark would be made that the German and Belgian treaties would prevent it.
"Then denounce the treaties," I would say.
"That would be a very serious thing, and would be hardly possible."
My reply was, "You have not fully considered the question, we have."
Then I would be asked what I meant, and would reply somewhat in these terms:   Consider the situation of affairs as they stand.
To-day at every port  of entry in Canada from Sydney, Cape Breton, to Victoria in the Island  of Vancouver, along 3,500 miles of Canadian frontier, German goods  are charged one-eighth more duty than goods from Great Britain, and  goods from Great Britain one-eighth less duty than on German goods.
This was being done yesterday, is being done to-day, and will be done  to-morrow, and it is done by the Government of Canada, backed by a  unanimous Parliament, and behind it a determined and united people.
We have made up our minds and have thought it out, and have our teeth  set, and what are you going to do about it?
This did not usually bring out any indication that any clear decision had been arrived at by them, and then I would go on:   Of course we know that you can send a large fleet to our Atlantic  ports, and another to our Pacific ports, and blockade them, paralyse  our trade, and stop our commerce, until we yield, or you may go  farther and bombard our defenceless cities, and kill our women and  children.
Well, go on and do it, and we will still hold out, for we  know that any British Government that would dare to send her fleets  to jamb German goods down our throats when we want to buy British,  would be turned out of office before the ships could get across the  Atlantic.
The thing is absurd, the treaties are an outrage, and the  only course out of the difficulty is to denounce them.
's, and others.
Once only the head of one of the great daily newspapers seemed to be annoyed at my aggressive attitude, and said, "You had better not be too sure.
We might send the fleet and be very ugly with you."
My reply was, "Well, go on and send it.
You lost the southern half of North America by trying to cram tea down their throats, and you may lose the northern half if you try to cram German goods down our throats.
I should have hoped you had learned something from history."
It will be seen that the plan which was, I understand, originated by D'Alton McCarthy, worked out very successfully.
There could only be one result, and within a month the treaties were denounced, and I felt that the first great step of our programme had been made.
The amusing feature, however, was, that this object for which we fought so hard three years before at the meeting at Lord Avebury's, when the British Empire League was founded, and which was opposed by nearly all our English friends, was no sooner announced as accomplished, than men of all parties and views seemed to unite in praising the act, and the Cobden Club even went so far as to present the Cobden Medal to Sir Wilfrid Laurier.
Sir Wilfrid Laurier in all his speeches had upheld abstract theories of free trade, and with considerable skill succeeded in allaying the hostility of the free trade element.
This, I think, helped to secure the denunciation of the treaties, with the approval of all parties.
On my return to Canada I was interviewed in Montreal by the representative of the Toronto _Globe_.
Being asked by the reporter my opinion of the probable effect of the denunciation of the German and Belgian treaties, I said:   The denunciation of these treaties marks an epoch in the history of  the British Empire.
The power of Canada has made itself felt not  only in British but in European diplomacy.
It has affected Germany,  Belgium, and other countries, and every one of these countries knows  that it was Canada's influence that produced the result.
Another point  in connection with the denunciation of these treaties is, that it is  a tremendous step towards preferential trade within the Empire.
Great  Britain was going along half asleep.
Canada has awakened her, and made  her sit up and think.
She has been jostled out of the rut she has been  following, and is now in a position to proceed in the direction that  may be in her own interest and in that of the Empire.
Being then asked if I had any opinions to express in regard to the Premier's remarks in Great Britain on the question of free trade, I said:   His remarks were general and theoretical.
The great point of the whole  movement was to secure the denunciation of the treaties.
Nothing could  be done while these treaties were in existence, and in my opinion  it would have been a most indiscreet thing for Sir Wilfrid Laurier  to have pursued any line of argument that would have aroused the  hostility of the great free trade party in Great Britain.
The great  point was to secure the united influence of all parties in favouring  the denunciation of the treaties, which was an important step in  advance.
Being asked to account for the fact that Sir Howard Vincent, of the United Empire Trade League, a strong protectionist, and the Cobden Club both united in applauding the denunciation of the treaties, I replied:   Sir Howard Vincent and his League saw plainly that this action made  for a preferential tariff.
The Cobden Club are whistling to keep up  their courage.
In the Conference of Premiers, held in 1897, it was not possible to secure an arrangement for mutual preferential tariffs.
The other colonies were not ready for it, the Imperial Government was not ready for it, nor were the people, but as the German and Belgian Treaties were denounced to take effect the following year, in August, 1898, the path was cleared, and from that date the Canadian Preference came into force, and has since been in operation.
It will be remembered that the deputation of our British Empire League to England, in 1897, was instructed to express the great desire of the Canadian Branch that, as a guarantee of the general safety of the Empire, vigorous steps should at once be taken to provide that the British Food supply should be grown within the Empire.
As chairman of the deputation I did all in my power to stir up inquiry on the subject.
Being introduced to Principal Ward of Owens College, Manchester, when at that city, I talked freely with him on the point, and he suggested I should discuss it with Mr. Spencer Wilkinson, the well-known author and journalist.
He gave me a letter introducing me to Mr. Wilkinson, and we had several interviews.
Shortly after reaching London I called to see my friend Lord Wolseley, then Commander-in-Chief.
He took me with him to his house to lunch, and as we walked over, I at once broached the subject of the food supply, principally wheat and flour, and he told me that the Government had been urged to look into the matter some two or three years before, and that there had been a careful inquiry by the best experts, and the report was that the command of the sea was a _sine quâ non_, but if we maintained that, and paid the cost which would be much increased by war prices, the country could get all the grain they would want.
I said suppose a war with Russia and the United States, what would be done if they combined and put an embargo on bread-stuffs?
How would it be got then even with full command of the sea?
He did not seem himself to have understood the difficulty, or studied the figures, and said, "I cannot explain the matter.
All I can say is that the Government obtained the advice of the best men in England on the subject, and that is their report."
My reply was, "I wish you would look into it yourself," and I dropped the subject.
I met Lord Roberts shortly after and I pressed the matter upon him.
He had not known of the Government report, and consequently listened to my arguments attentively and seemed impressed, for I may say that 1897 was the worst year in all our history as to the manner in which the supply of food was distributed among the nations.
Mr. Spencer Wilkinson seemed to be much interested in my talks with him, and one day he said, "I wish you could have a conversation with some great authority on the other side of the question, who would understand the matter and be able to answer you."
I replied, "That is what I should like very much.
Tell me the best man you have and I will tackle him.
If he throws me over in the gutter in our discussion it will be a good thing, for then I shall learn something."
Mr. Wilkinson laughed at my way of putting it, and said, "If that is what you want, Sir Robert Giffen is the man for you to see."
I said I would try and get a letter of introduction to him.
Mr. Wilkinson said he would give me one, and did so.
I called to see Sir Robert Giffen.
He received me very kindly, and we had an interesting interview of about an hour.
The moment I broached the subject of the food supply he said at once, "That question came up some two or three years ago, and I was called upon to inquire into the whole matter and report upon it, and my report in a few words was, that we must have the command of the sea, and that once that was secured, then, by paying the somewhat enhanced war prices, we could get all the grain required."
My reply was, "Then, as you have fully inquired into the question, you can tell me what you could do under certain conditions.
In case of a war between Great Britain and Russia combined with the United States, followed by an embargo on food products, where and how would you get your supplies?"
Sir Robert said, "We do not expect to go to war with the United States and Russia at the same time."
I said, "You were within an ace of war with the United States only a year ago over the Venezuelan difficulty, and Great Britain and Russia have been snarling at each other over the Indian Frontier for years, and if you go to war with either, you must count on having the other on your hands."
Sir Robert then said, "But I said we must have the command of the sea."
I replied, "I will give you the complete, undoubted, absolute command of the sea, everywhere all the time, although you are not likely to have it; and then in case of an embargo on wheat and foodstuffs where are you to get your supplies?"
He said, "We would get some from Canada and other countries."
I pointed out that all they sent was only a fraction.
Sir Robert then said, "They could not put on an embargo, for it would ruin their trade."
I told him that I was talking about war and not about peace and trade, and said that no desire for trade induced the Germans to sell wheat to Paris during the siege of 1870.
His idea had been that, in case of war with Russia or the United States, or both, holding the command of the sea, Great Britain would allow foodstuffs to be exported to neutral countries such as Belgium or Holland, and then England would import from those countries.
My answer to that was, that if England had the command of the sea, the United States or Russia would have only one weapon, an embargo, and they would certainly use it.
He seemed cornered in the argument, and said, "Well, if we cannot get bread we can eat meat.
I eat very little bread."
I said, "The British people use about 360 lbs.
per head of wheat per annum, and about 90 lbs.
of meat, and a great deal of meat would be stopped too"; and I said on leaving, "I wish you would investigate this thoroughly again, and let the Government know, for I know they are depending upon your report at the War Office"; and then I left him.
When at Liverpool shortly after on my way back to Canada, I asked the manager of the Bank of Liverpool, to whom I had a letter of introduction, if he would introduce me to the highest authority on the corn trade in Liverpool.
He introduced me to the late Mr. Paul, ex-President of the Corn Exchange, and I had a long conversation with him on the question of the food supply.
As soon as I mentioned the subject he told me that the corn trade people in Liverpool had been asked from London to make a report on the possibility of supplying grain in case of war.
Mr. Paul told me that they had considered the matter (I suppose he meant the leading corn merchants), and that their report was practically that they must have the command of the sea, that was essential; but that secured, and the enhanced war prices paid, they could supply all the corn required in any contingency.
I questioned him as I had Sir Robert Giffen and found the same underlying belief.
The law of supply and demand would settle the question.
The corn would be allowed to go in neutral ships to neutral ports, and then be transhipped to England.
An embargo had not been considered or treated seriously as a possibility, and when I cornered him so that he could not answer my arguments, he said, "Well, if we could not get wheat we could live on potatoes."
I told him potatoes could not be kept over a year, that a large quantity was imported which would be stopped.
I said he had better make another report.
The whole thing was very disheartening to me, for I saw how the Government were depending upon peaceful traders for information how to guard against war dangers.
In 1902 when Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, proposed a small tax on wheat and flour, I was pleased to see that Sir Robert Giffen was the first prominent man to write to the Press endorsing and approving of the bread tax, as it was called.
It showed me that Sir Robert had carefully considered the question, and was manly enough to advocate what was not altogether a popular idea.
After my return to Canada I prepared an article for the _Nineteenth Century_ on the "Situation in England," and it appeared in the December number, 1897.
In this I pointed out the danger of the condition of the food supply, and the article attracted a considerable amount of attention in the British Press, in comments, notices, letters, etc.
Sir Michael Hicks-Beach in a speech at Bristol, in January, 1898, referred to the question, and in a way contradicted the points I had brought out in the _Nineteenth Century_ article.
My conversations the summer before with Lord Wolseley, Sir Robert Giffen, and Mr. Paul had so alarmed me at the false security in which the Government were resting, that when I saw Sir Michael Hicks-Beach relying on the same official reports, I determined, although I had never met him, to write him direct, and on the 20th January, 1898, I wrote, drawing his attention to a remark which he was reported to have made that "in any war England would have many friends ready to supply corn," and I said, "Our League sent a deputation to England last summer to draw attention to the danger of the food supply.
I was chairman of it.
Since my return I published an article in the _Nineteenth Century_ giving our views.
I enclose a reprint which I wish you could read.
If you have not time please give me one minute to examine the enclosed diagram (cut out of the _Chicago Tribune_) showing the corn export of the world.
This shows that Russia and the United States control, not including the Danubian ports, nearly 95 per cent.
of the world's needs, and if they were to put an embargo on the export of food of all kinds, where would be the 'many friends ready to supply England with corn?'"
Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, now Lord St. Aldwyn, with great courtesy wrote me a personal letter, in which he thanked me for my letter, and went on to say:   I do not think that the sentence you quote "that in any war England  would have many friends ready to supply corn" quite accurately  represents what I said on that subject.
The report was necessarily  much condensed.
But it would be true if (say) we were at war with the  United States alone: or if we were at war with one or more of the  European Powers and the United States were neutral.
In either of such  cases the interests of the neutral Powers in access to our market  would be so strong, that our enemy would not venture to close it to  them, in the only possible way, viz.
: by declaring corn contraband of  war.
And I think that if the United States were the neutral party,  self-interest would weigh more with them than their ill feeling  towards us, whatever the amount of that feeling may be.
It is possible, though most improbable, that the two great  corn-producing countries might be allied against us.
If they were, I  believe that our navy would still keep the seas open for our supply  from other sources, though no doubt there would be comparative  scarcity and suffering.
I am no believer in the enclosed diagram, the  production of corn is constantly increasing in new countries such as  the Argentine, and better communication is also increasing the total  amount available for export.
Bad harvests in the United States and  Russia, and good ones in India and the Argentine, would show quite  another result to that shown in the enclosed, though, as I have said,  I do not believe it is true, even of the year which it professes to  represent.
On receipt of this letter I wrote to Mr. Geo.
J. S. Broomhall, of Liverpool, editor of the _Corn Trade News_, and author of the _Corn Trade Year Book_, and received from him a certificate of the correct figures of corn exports.
I forwarded it to Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, showing that in 1897 India and the Argentine only exported 200,000 qrs.
and 740,000 qrs.
respectively, and that the diagram I sent could not have been a very great way out.
In 1902 Sir Michael Hicks-Beach put a tax of one shilling a quarter on imported wheat, and as I have already said, Sir Robert Giffen wrote to the _Times_ approving of it.
I was very glad to see this action on the part of both of them.
On the 4th December, 1897, the Hon.
George W. Ross gave an address before the British Empire League in St George's Hall, Toronto, in which he strongly favoured preferential tariffs and came out squarely against reciprocity with the United States.
This action was a great encouragement to our cause and attracted considerable attention all over Canada.
On the 8th December, 1897, the National Club gave a complimentary banquet to his Excellency the Earl of Aberdeen, Governor-General.
I attended the banquet and sat second to the left of the president of the club, Mr. McNaught.
I was under the impression that Mr. Blake, who had been a few years away from Canada, and who had joined the Irish Nationalist party, would be sure to speak in a strain not acceptable to our club.
I mentioned this to Dr. Parkin who sat next to me.
When Mr. Blake began to speak he very soon uttered sentiments strongly opposed to all that the Canadians had been working for in the Imperial interest.
I said to Parkin that as an ex-president of the club, and president of the British Empire League, I would not allow his remarks to pass without comment.
I leaned over and told the chairman I intended to speak a few minutes when Mr. Blake finished.
He raised some objection, but I told him I must speak.
He mentioned it to the Governor-General, who said he would wait for fifteen minutes.
I told Dr. Parkin I would divide the time with him.
After Mr. Blake sat down, I said:   I have been a member of this club almost from its foundation.
I was  for many years on the Board of Directors, and for some years its  President, and I feel that I should state that the speech of my friend  Mr. Blake does not represent the views nor the national aspirations  which have always been characteristic of the National Club.
I agree with what Mr. Blake has said as to the importance of  preserving friendly relations with the United States.
We hope to live  at peace with them, but because we do not wish to beg for reciprocity  or make humiliating concessions for the sake of greater trade, it is  no reason why we should be charged with wanting war.
We want peace,  and no one can point to any instance where the Canadian people or  Government have been responsible for the irritation.
Mr. G. W. Ross  pointed this out clearly in his admirable speech of Saturday night.
The great causes of irritation have come from the United States.
The invasion of 1775, the war of 1812, the Trent affair, and the  Venezuelan business were all matters in which we were absolutely free  from blame.
Nor were we to blame some thirty years ago when I had to  turn out with my corps to help defend the frontier of this province  from the attacks of bands of Fenians, organised, armed, and equipped,  in the United States, who invaded our country, and shot down some of  my comrades, who died defending Canada.
These raids were maintained  by contributions from our worst enemies in the United States,  but we drove them out, and now I am glad to say that, while the  contributions still go on, the proceeds are devoted to troubling the  Empire elsewhere, and I hope they will continue to be expended in that  direction rather than against us.
I approve of Mr. Blake's remarks about the defence of Canada, and the  expenditure of money to make our country safer, but I object strongly  to the hopeless view he takes.
We are 6,000,000 of northern men, and,  fighting on our own soil for our rights and freedom, I believe we  could hold our own in spite of the odds against us, as our fathers did  in days gone by, when the outlook was much more gloomy.
Dr. George R. Parkin followed with an eloquent and powerful speech pointing out the various arguments which showed the growth of the movement for Imperial unity.
It was thought at that time that Mr. Blake had some idea of returning to Canadian politics, but the result of this meeting and the Press comments must have put an end to any such idea if it ever existed.
Field-Marshal Sir Henry Norman disagreed with the other two members of the Commission, and put in a minority report, showing in effect that the real way to relieve the distress in the sugar industry of the West Indies, was for Great Britain to put countervailing duties on bounty favoured sugar coming into her markets.
I was much impressed with Sir Henry Norman's report as to the condition of the West Indies, and came to the conclusion that we in Canada might do something to aid on Imperial grounds.
I wrote, therefore, to Principal George M. Grant, one of our most energetic and brilliant colleagues, asking him to let me know when he would be in Toronto, as I wished to have a long conference with him.
On the 29th December, 1897, we met, and I discussed the whole question with him and asked him to go to Ottawa, and urge Sir Wilfrid Laurier and Mr.
Fielding to increase the sugar duty in order that Canada might be able to give a preference to West Indian Sugar.
I pointed out that such action would be popular, and that I was satisfied both parties would support it.
I had been pressing Sir Wilfrid and the Government on many points, and thought that in this matter they had better be approached from a different angle.
Grant took up the idea eagerly, and promised to go to Ottawa and do his best.
On the 3rd January, 1898, he wrote me "(Private and confidential)":   A Happy New Year to you!
I have just returned from Ottawa.
Had an  hour with Fielding discussing the West Indian question, which he  understands thoroughly.
I think that something will be done, though  perhaps not all that we might wish at first.
Had an hour also with Laurier.
First, the preference hereafter is  to be confined to Britain.
That is settled, but this is of course  strictly confidential.
Secondly, he seemed at first to think that we had gone far enough with  our twenty-five per cent.
reduction, till we could see its workings,  but when I argued for going steadily along that line he said, "I do  not say yea, but I do not say nay."
I intend to push the matter.
He is in favour of the cable, but thinks that we cannot take it up  this session.
He impresses me favourably the more I study him.
He has a truer  understanding of the forces in Britain than Tupper in my opinion.
Of course I told Fielding that the West Indian suggestion was yours,  and that I cordially endorsed it.
He is anxious to do something, but  thinks that we must ask in dealing with them a _quid pro quo_.
Shortly before it was announced Sir Wilfrid Laurier told me the Government were likely to give West Indian sugar a preference.
And on the 5th April, 1898, Mr.
Fielding introduced his Budget, and in a most eloquent and statesmanlike speech declared that Canada had her Imperial responsibilities, and that she would lend "a helping hand to our sister colonies in the south."
This was received with great applause from both sides of the House, and Grant and I were not only much pleased at the success of our efforts, but still more gratified to find the universal feeling in Canada in favour of Mr.
Fielding's action.
A few days after, on the 9th April, Grant wrote to me:   I am sure that my thorough discussion on the West India matter with  Mr.
Fielding did good, but the suggestion came from you.
We may be  well satisfied with the action of the Government, but it will be bad  if the public gets the idea that the British Empire League is pressing  them.
It is our task rather to educate public opinion.
Things are  moving steadily in the right direction.
P.S.--Mulock is evidently aiming at Imperial penny postage.
Some time after this the German Government put the maximum tariff against all Canadian goods, and Mr.
Fielding met this by a surtax of ten per cent.
on all German goods entering Canada.
This changed the whole supply of sugar for Canada from Germany to the West Indies to their great advantage.
On the 10th March, 1898, the Annual Meeting of the British Empire League was held in the Private Bills Committee Room in the House of Commons.
It was a most successful meeting.
Four Cabinet Ministers were present, Sir Louis Davies, Sir Wm.
Mulock, Hon.
J. Israel Tarte, and Hon.
Charles Fitzpatrick.
Sir Charles Tupper and Sir Mackenzie Bowell ex Prime Ministers, and many members of the Senate and the House.
Those named above addressed the meeting as well as Principal Grant and Colonel Sam Hughes.
Mulock succeeded this year in securing Imperial Penny Postage, which was one of the objects for which the British Empire League had been working.
It was managed with great boldness and skill by Mr. Mulock.
His first step was to announce that on and after a certain date some three or four months in advance, all letters stamped with the ordinary three cent domestic rate would be carried to Great Britain without further charge.
He knew that objection would be raised to his action, but that it would bring the question to the forefront.
The Imperial Government objected to deliver the letters, and said the matter would have to be considered at a conference.
Mr. Mulock then answered that a conference should be held, which was agreed to, but he insisted it should not be a departmental affair, that he should only be asked to discuss it with men of his own rank, that is with Cabinet Ministers.
This also was agreed to, and it was not long before the matter was settled.
Mr. Mulock sent me a cable telling me of his success as soon as he came out of the meeting where the resolution was passed.
On the 28th August, 1898, a large deputation of the Executive Committee of the British Empire League met Mr. Mulock at the Toronto railway station on his arrival from England, to welcome him home, to congratulate him upon his success, and to invite him to a complimentary banquet to be given in his honour.
The banquet took place on the 15th September, at the National Club.
Principal Grant, Alexander McNeill, and Sir Sandford Fleming all came to Toronto to attend it.
It was a most successful affair.
The Lieut.-Governor Sir Oliver Mowat, who was one of our vice-presidents, attended, also Lord Herschel, Hon.
Richard Herschel, Hon.
Charles Russell, Sir Frank Smith, Mayor Shaw, and a large and distinguished company.
I was in the chair and proposed the health of Mr. Mulock.
The _World_ of the following day, the 16th September, 1898, reported me as follows:   Colonel Denison, inspired by the nobility of the dominant idea of  the evening, looked like a general standing on the ramparts just won  by his troops.
He spoke of the double aim of the League, to preserve  the permanency of the British Empire, and secondly to procure closer  intercourse between the parts.
He dwelt on the wonderful advance  made by the idea of federation and the disappearance of the "Little  Englander."
It was not enough to denounce the German and Belgian  treaties, or to have a preferential tariff.
There should be no rest  until a mutual preferential tariff had been secured.
Lord Herschel, Sir Oliver Mowat, Mr. Mulock, Principal Grant, Alexander McNeill, Sir Sandford Fleming, Mr. George Hague of Montreal, Geo.
E. Casey, and W. F. Maclean all made loyal and patriotic speeches, Alexander McNeill's being especially eloquent and powerful.
Our League was much gratified not long afterwards at an article which appeared in the London _Daily Mail_ of the 21st November, 1898, under the heading "Where Imperialism comes from."
After referring to many things Canada had done, preferential tariffs and preferences to the West Indies, penny postage, &c., it concluded as follows:   By their works ye shall know them, and by the record of Canada's works  is her magnificent, constructive, peaceful Imperialism made known to  the world.
Yet its full strength can only be measured by going among  Canadians in their homes and noting--and becoming affected by--the  palpitating Imperialist life of the people, which even the coldness of  the mother country cannot damp.
When future historians come to write  the history of the Empire's later development they will have much to  say of Canada's Imperialist lead.
At present we don't make half enough  of this rich and beautiful Dominion--an Empire in itself--and its  enthusiastically loyal sons.
In moving the adoption of the Annual Report, I made an address which clearly outlined the policy of the League at that time, and may therefore be worth quoting.
It appears in the report printed by order of the annual meeting as follows:   The year that has passed since we last met has been a most important  year in reference to the work of the British Empire League, and many  striking events have happened which teach us lessons that we should  carefully consider in framing our policy for the future.
We have many  things upon which we can look with great satisfaction.
Since we last  met the preference in our markets, which under certain conditions had  previously been open to all countries, has been restricted to our  empire.
A preference has also been given to our sister colonies in  the West Indies, and this example, we are gratified to find, has in  a way been imitated by the Government of India, with the approval of  the British Government, which is another move in the direction of the  aims of our league.
Almost simultaneously we see the London _Times_  discussing a duty on wheat and sugar as a means of raising revenue.
As  this would not only raise revenue but help to raise wheat in Britain  as well, it would aid to that extent in strengthening the empire.
In  reference to the preference to West Indian sugar, I wish to point  out that I am informed that cane sugar in the United States has a  preference through duties on beet root sugar, which, at present, is an  advantage to West Indian sugar to the extent of 27 cents per hundred  pounds, while the preference we have given in our market is only about  18 cents per hundred pounds.
I may suggest that we in Canada should  increase our preference to, say, 40 per cent.
of the duty, which would  give our fellow-colonists a slightly greater preference than they now  receive under the United States tariff.
I need not say much about  the fast Atlantic service, for all parties are united in favour of  it, and we can only hope that it will be established at the earliest  moment, for nothing would help more to show our position as a separate  community upon this continent.
We have been too backward in the past,  and we should endeavour more and more to assert ourselves among the  countries of the world.
There is one point I wish to press upon this meeting: there has been  in the last twenty-five or thirty years a revolution in the affairs of  the world in reference to national relations and methods of defence.
Germany has united, and we remember that it was accomplished under  the stress and trial of war.
The German Empire was inaugurated in the  greatest palace of France, to the sound of the German cannon firing  upon the capital city of their enemy.
Italy, as the result of three  wars, has been united and consolidated.
The United States during the  last year have launched out into the politics of the world, have  adopted expansion as their policy, and are pressing their views on  the Filipinos with rifles, maxims, and field guns.
We have discovered  this year once more by hard facts what history in all ages has  shown--that nations cannot expect to exist upon the security of their  natural moral rights, unless those rights are supported by physical  strength.
Spain has been taught that might prevails, and she has  been crushed and humiliated for doing what the United States are now  obliged to do themselves in the Philippine Islands.
The greatest  lesson of all, however, which this last year has taught us is that  which we learn from the impending fate of China.
There is a nation of  three hundred to four hundred millions of people, honest traders, I  am told, certainly most inoffensive and unaggressive; a nation which,  from its peaceful character, industrious habits, and natural reserve,  should have been the last to have aroused hostility.
It has neglected  its defences and has taken no effective steps to protect itself from  wrong, and what do we see now as the result?
The nations in the  possession of navies and armies are commencing to tear it to pieces  and divide the spoils.
Do we hear of any of these nations being worried by conscientious  scruples, or complaining of the moral wrong of this partition?
No; the  whole disputing is concentrated over the division of the spoils.
Now  what is the lesson this thing teaches us?
It is this; that nations  can only enjoy their freedom by being able to defend it, and that the  true policy for nations under present conditions is to be closely  united within themselves, to be thoroughly organised and equipped, and  to be able in case of necessity to use their whole strength to the  greatest advantage for the common safety--and to do this nations must  be self-sustaining.
(Applause.)
In trade, also, we see the selfish war going on and increasing.
While  England is talking about the "open door," which is a fine phrase for  theorists, she is finding other nations busily engaged in shutting  their own doors.
Each nation year by year is being forced to protect  its industries by tariff regulations.
France is following this policy;  Germany and Russia also, and the most prosperous of them all, the  United States, is carrying the principle to the greatest extent.
One can see that this principle is growing and will grow, for the  selfishness of nations seems, if possible, to be increasing every day.
Now, how is the British nation placed?
It has the best chances of all  if it sees how to take advantage of them.
It has the largest territory, with every variety of climate and  products, with the greatest possibilities of development, with  prospects of an internal trade far beyond all other countries.
It has  the best coaling stations scattered everywhere, but to secure and  retain her advantages the empire must be consolidated, both for trade  and defence, and this can be fully accomplished without the slightest  aggression.
(Hear, hear.)
If we Canadians desire to be free and safe it must be in that empire  to which we are attached by every tie, and to which we must be ready  to give our strength for the common defence, if we expect the enormous  reserve force of that empire to be at our back if our life as a free  people should ever be threatened.
(Applause.)
It is necessary, therefore, for the prosperity and safety of all the  parts, that the United Kingdom, India, Australasia, South Africa, and  Canada should all be firmly united so as to show a square front to  any enemies that may attack us.
This is the object of our league; to  secure the permanent unity of the empire; and with the extraordinary  development of nations and of military progress in them, our empire  must also, if it desires security, be ready in every part to pay for  that security and be ready to defend it.
In past ages the wars between nations have been carried on by moderate  sized armies, while the great bulk of the people attended to their  usual business, except where interrupted in the actual theatre of war.
For a thousand years wars had been conducted upon that principle,  until the French Revolution, when in 1793, being threatened with  invasion by combined Europe, 1,300,000 men were conscripted in France  to defend her frontier.
This was the first example of a nation almost  taking up arms to defend herself.
It changed the organisation of  armies; but later, under Napoleon, the nation returned more nearly  to the old system of regular armies.
In 1870 and since, however, the  revolution in military defence in most civilised countries except our  own has been completed.
Now in France, Germany, and Russia the whole  people practically are trained for war.
The war footing of the army in  France is about 4,000,000 and some thousands of field guns; in Germany  just about the same; in Russia the army on a war footing is said  to be 3,400,000; Austria has a war strength of 2,750,000.
As these  forces in these countries are all organised, and arms, equipment, and  field guns ready, it will be seen that never before in history were  such enormous military preparations made.
The navies have increased  almost in the same ratio, our navy fortunately being more than equal  to any two navies combined.
With this outlook, with this condition of  affairs outside, it is only wisdom for the wealthiest of all nations  to consolidate its power in order to preserve its wealth, possessions,  and liberty.
And what are we in Canada doing?
We are following the example of the  Chinese, and trusting to the forbearance and sense of honesty of other  nations, instead of relying upon our own strength and the strength of  the empire, to which we could better appeal if we did our own share  properly.
Thirty-eight thousand militia, drilled spasmodically, without the  necessary equipment and departments, without reserves, or even rifles  to arm them, is no contribution to the strength of the empire.
This  should be changed at once.
(Hear, hear.)
Our militia should be largely increased, and supplies of all  kinds provided, and in agreeing to do our share in developing and  strengthening the military resources of the empire, in our own  borders, we could fairly ask the mother country to remedy a danger  which at present menaces the safety of our race.
I spoke very plainly on this point of the food supply last year, but  the intervening months have produced such strong evidence in support  of my arguments that I wish to draw attention to the subject again.
I  said last year that an embargo on foodstuffs in Russia and the United  States, rigidly carried out, would force the surrender of the mother  country in a very few months.
I have been told by trade theorists in  England that the demand would create the supply, and that England  could purchase food through neutral countries.
I argued that an  embargo by the two countries mentioned would necessarily be followed  by an embargo in all important countries at once, and in all other  countries as soon as their surplus was exported.
This last year has  seen this view triumphantly vindicated.
Mr. Leiter effected a corner  in wheat in Chicago, purchasers became alarmed, prices increased, and  wheat began to be picked up in other countries.
What was the result?
Spain, a country which about feeds itself, put on an embargo.
I  believe Italy did the same, or was on the point of doing so, while an  embargo was being discussed in France and Germany.
If this could be  the result of the cornering operations of one dealer in one town in  one exporting country, what would have happened if those two countries  which control nearly nine-tenths of the wheat exports of the world  were to withhold that amount?
I have been told that no country could put on an embargo, that the  people would rebel against being prevented from selling their  produce, but I have one example which conclusively proves my argument.
The southern States had the bulk of the cotton supply of the world  when the Civil war broke out in 1860.
Their main industry was growing  cotton, their capital, labour, and business were mainly involved in  the production and sale of it.
To force Great Britain to recognise  and assist them, in other words, to bring pressure to bear upon a  neutral power, the southern Government placed an embargo on the export  of cotton.
At Great Britain's request the northern Government agreed  to give permits to let it go to England.
So that it was not the  blockade alone which prevented its export.
The southern Government  maintained a strict embargo.
When their troops were forced back  the stores of cotton were seized and paid for by the Confederate  Government by receipts and Government bonds, and the cotton was  burned.
Mrs. Jefferson Davis, in her memoirs, says that her husband  grudged every pound that got out.
Now let us see what was the result  of this embargo, and how far it was possible to enforce it.
In 1860,  England imported from the United States 1,115,890,608 pounds; in 1861,  England imported from the United States, 819,500,528 pounds; in 1862,  England imported from the United States 13,524,224 pounds; in 1863,  England imported from the United States 6,394,080 pounds; in 1864,  England imported from the United States 14,198,688 pounds.
The drop  from 1,115,890,608 to 6,394,080 pounds, about one-half of one per  cent, shows how complete this embargo was.
The cotton famine has not  been forgotten.
The loss to the English people has been computed at  £65,000,000, and yet this only affected one industry in one section of  one kingdom.
(Hear, hear.)
Nine-tenths of the population were able to help; the tenth affected,  and there was abundance of food for all.
But extend that pressure,  and let it be in food, which no one can do without, and let it extend  over the whole ten-tenths (as would be the case in the event of a  stoppage of food) and try to imagine the misery that would follow.
Food would have to be rationed to rich and poor alike, for the  starving masses would not allow all there was to be monopolised by  the wealthy.
Under such conditions, what heart could the Government  be expected to display in the conduct of the struggle?
Russia and the  United States could control the export of 40,000,000 quarters out of  45,375,000 quarters exported by all nations in 1897.
The late war  between the United States and Spain is said to have cost the States  nearly $500,000,000.
If the Government of Russia and the United States  bought the full surplus from their people of 320,000,000 bushels at  the present market price, it would only cost them about $225,000,000,  while even at $1 a bushel it would only be $320,000,000--the cheapest  and most effective war measure that could be adopted.
And this could  be done by these countries without their having one war vessel.
I  repeat, therefore, that this is the weak point of our empire; our food  should be grown under our own flag, or there should be large stores  in England, and a preference which would increase the growth of wheat  to the extent of 10,000,000 quarters additional in the British Isles  would be the best spent money for defence that could be expended, and  a preference to the colonies would soon produce the balance within the  Empire.
(Hear, hear.)
We should urge this upon the mother country, not because it would help  us enormously, though that is no reason why we should not urge it, but  because danger to the mother country is danger to us all.
These are the two points for us to look forward to, a thorough  organisation of our own forces in Canada, with a liberal assistance  from us toward the royal naval reserve and other defences of the  empire, and a provision, for the food supply of the empire being  made safe.
These should go together, for there is not much use in  our sending our sailors, well trained, to man war vessels, to defend  our empire, unless it is understood that a ship without food is as  useless as one without guns, or powder or coal or men.
A number of  requisites are absolutely necessary to make an effective navy, or an  effective defence, and the want of one makes all the others useless,  and food is one of these indispensable requisites.
We cannot press  this too earnestly upon the mother country, but we cannot talk to  them about their duties or necessities until we first attend to ours,  and show our willingness to take up our share of the common burden.
The answer to my argument from the English point of view is that my  suggestion to secure a safe supply of food might be a great material  advantage to Canada.
This should not be considered.
A preference to  the British farmer would increase the growth of wheat to sixteen or  seventeen million quarters in the United Kingdom.
This would do us no  good financially, but would be a great service to us, because it would  make our empire more secure.
If large stores of grain were accumulated in England, it would be no  advantage to us pecuniarily, but it would strengthen the whole empire,  and I for one would be delighted to see either plan adopted, for at  present none of us are safe.
No nation or power can be independent  that is not self-dependent.
The lesson taught us by the course of  events is to consolidate and unite our empire, both for trade and  defence.
(Applause.)
Another movement which has spread over the Empire was started this year to help Imperial sentiment.
Mrs. Clementine Fessenden of Hamilton wrote to the Hon.
G. W. Ross suggesting the establishment of an Empire Day to be celebrated in the schools by patriotic exercises, readings, and addresses.
Mr. Ross was favourably impressed with the idea and inaugurated the movement at a large meeting held in the Theatre of the Normal School, Toronto, on the 23rd May 1899, which was attended by most of the school teachers of the City and many others.
I was asked by Mr. Ross to address the meeting, which I did.
Mr. Ross himself, Mr. N. F. Rowell and Mr. Sanford Evans were the other speakers.
This idea has been taken up by Lord Meath in England, and has spread throughout the empire, but that meeting in the Normal School was the beginning of the movement.
As early as the 26th April, 1899, Mr. George Evans, Secretary of the British Empire League received the following cablegram from Kimberley, South Africa.
"Twenty-one thousand British subjects, Transvaal, have petitioned Imperial Government obtain redress grievances and secure them status which their numbers, industry, stake in country, entitle them.
We strongly sympathise, if you do too, would you as kindred Societies cable Imperial Government sympathetic resolution."
"Signed, South African League Congress, Kimberley, representing 10,000 enrolled members."
At this time we knew very little of the state of affairs in South Africa, or of the merits of the dispute, and there was a hazy idea that the Boers had opened up the country and should not be disturbed, and after a conference of the principal members of the Executive Committee it was decided to forward the cable to the Head Office of the League in England leaving the matter in their hands.
A cable was sent to Kimberley telling them that we had asked the Head Office to decide what to do.
Principal Grant at the beginning of the difficulties in South Africa, in the early summer of 1899, was in sympathy with the Boers as against the gold seeking speculators of Johannesburg, and publicly expressed his views in that way.
I sympathised somewhat with his view, but advised him to keep quiet, saying we could not tell how events might shape, and we might have to take a strong stand on the other side.
I felt I did not understand the question.
In the following July, Mr. J. Davis Allen, representing the South African Association, came from England to Ottawa, and explained to the Canadian authorities the situation in South Africa and urged the passing of a resolution that would strengthen the hands of the British Government, in its negotiations with Mr. Kruger and the Transvaal Government.
Mr. Alexander McNeill naturally took up the cause and wrote to me asking me to go to Ottawa to help Mr. Davis Allen in his efforts.
I declined to go, saying I did not sufficiently understand the question, but a few days later, on the 31st July, 1899, Sir Wilfrid Laurier introduced and Parliament unanimously adopted a resolution which concluded as follows:   That the House of Commons desires to express its sympathy with the  efforts of Her Majesty's Imperial authorities, to obtain for the  subjects of Her Majesty who have taken up their abode in the Transvaal  such measures of justice and political recognition as may be found  necessary to secure them in the full possession of equal rights and  liberties.
This resolution, seconded by the Hon.
George E. Foster, was carried unanimously, and the House rose and sang "God Save the Queen."
Mr. Allen came to Toronto on the 10th August.
Mr. McNeill had written to me saying that Mr. Allen was coming to see me, and we had several long interviews.
He explained to me the whole situation, and read me some of Lord Milner's despatches in which he pointed out clearly the dangers that were looming up.
He explained that the whole trouble was a conspiracy on the part of the Boers to drive the British out of South Africa altogether.
He insisted that the Orange Free State was deeply engaged in it, and that the Dutch in the Cape Colony were also involved.
All that Mr. Allen told me was absolutely verified before six months had elapsed.
After these explanations, and reading the despatches of Lord Milner, I took up a very decided stand against the Boers.
He also offered to raise a regiment, or brigade, for service in case war should break out.
Other officers in various parts of the country made similar offers.
Sir Charles Tupper, about the end of September, came out boldly in favour of offering a contingent, and agreed to help the Government in Parliament in any action they might take in that direction.
On the 25th September there was a small meeting of senior officers in Toronto, Lieut.-Colonel James Mason being the moving spirit.
At that meeting we decided to call a meeting of the members of the Canadian Military Institute for Saturday, the 30th September, to consider the question of what Canada should do.
The _Globe_ of the 2nd October, 1899, reported me in part as follows:   Lieut.-Colonel Denison followed.
In his opening remarks he expressed  the belief that there was no difference of opinion among British  peoples, except those in South Africa, in regard to the question.
The  opinion had prevailed to a certain extent that the question was simply  one as to the rights of the Uitlanders in the Transvaal.
He was bound  to admit that up to a certain period that had been his impression, and  that being the case he had not been convinced that the matter was one  which necessitated the Empire's going to war.
Some time ago, however,  he had been in the position of learning a good deal about the inside  working of affairs in South Africa from one who was thoroughly posted  in all the details.
He had then discovered that it had got altogether  beyond any question of interest or rights of the Uitlanders, and  that for the last few years there had been a widespread conspiracy  among the Dutch-speaking settlers over the whole of South Africa for  the purpose of ousting the British.
Ample proof was constantly being  furnished as to the continuity of this conspiracy.
Sir Alfred Milner's  despatch of 14th May stated in the plainest possible language that  such was the case, and it was a question whether Britain was to hold  the balance of power in that part of the world or be driven out of  it altogether.
The conspiracy extended further back than the Jameson  raid, and was one of the hidden causes leading to that affair.
It was  because of it that the English people and Government had become so  angry over the famous telegram sent by the German Emperor to President  Kruger.
Continuing, Colonel Denison said it could not be gainsaid that  the question was one of vital importance to the whole empire,  and Canadians were as much interested as any of Her Majesty's  subjects.
The Dominion had not fully and properly appreciated  her responsibilities as part of a great empire.
If Canada was an  independent nation of six millions of people it would have to  support a standing army of 40,000 men, besides reserves of 200,000  or 300,000.
"Is it right," he asked, "that we should all the time  be dependent upon the home Government and the British fleet for  protection?
Is it fair that we should not give any proper assistance?
What kind of treatment would we have received from Washington in the  Behring's Sea business or in reference to this Alaskan question if we  had not had behind us the power of the Empire?"
Such a course was not only selfish but impolitic and foolish.
In his  opinion not only should one contingent of 1,500 men be offered in the  present crisis, but another 1,500 should be immediately got together  and drilled so as to be ready in case of emergency.
No one could tell  where the thing was going to end, and reverses might be expected  in the beginning.
Other great nations envied the power of Britain  and would be ready to seize the opportunity if the Empire was in a  tight hole.
Therefore they should be prepared, not only to send one  contingent and have another on hand ready for the call, but should  be in a position to relieve the garrisons at Halifax and Esquimalt,  allowing the regulars to be added to the forces in the field.
"We have  been children long enough," he concluded; "let us show the Empire that  we have grown to manhood."
He then moved "That the members of the Canadian Military Institute,  feeling that it is a clear and definite duty for all British  possessions to show their willingness to contribute to the common  defence in case of need, express the hope that in view of impending  hostilities in South Africa the Government of Canada will promptly  offer a contingent of Canadian militia to assist in supporting the  interests of our Empire in that country."
This was carried unanimously.
This meeting started a strong movement of public opinion in favour of the Government making an offer.
On the 3rd October an article appeared in the Canadian _Military Gazette_ which began in these words: "If war should be commenced in the Transvaal--which seems most probable--the offer of a force from the Canadian Militia for service will be made by the Canadian Government," and it went on to give details of the composition and methods of organising the force.
Sir Wilfrid Laurier, on behalf of the Government, at once disavowed it, and on the same day gave an interview to the _Globe_, which appeared in that paper on the 4th October.
He said:   There exists a great deal of misconception in the country regarding  the powers of the Government in the present case.
As I understand  the Militia Act--and I may say that I have given it some study of  late--our volunteers are enrolled to be used in defence of the  Dominion.
They are Canadian troops to be used to fight for Canada's  defence.
Perhaps the most widespread misapprehension is that they  cannot be sent out of Canada.
To my mind they might be sent to a  foreign land to fight.
To postulate a case: Suppose that Spain should  declare war upon Great Britain.
Spain has or had a navy, but that  navy might be being got ready to assail Canada as part of the empire.
Sometimes the best method of defending one's self is to attack, and  in that case Canadian soldiers might certainly be sent to Spain,  and it is quite certain that they legally might be so despatched to  the Iberian Peninsula.
The case of the South African Republic is  not analogous.
There is no menace to Canada, and although we may be  willing to contribute troops, I do not see how we can do so.
Then,  again, how could we do so without Parliament's granting us the money?
We simply could not do anything.
In other words, we should have to  summon Parliament.
The Government of Canada is restricted in its  powers.
It is responsible to Parliament, and it can do very little  without the permission of Parliament.
There is no doubt as to the  attitude of the Government on all questions that mean menace to  British interests, but in this present case our limitations are very  clearly defined.
And so it is that we have not offered a Canadian  contingent to the Home authorities.
The Militia Department duly  transmitted individual offers to the Imperial Government and the reply  from the War Office, as published in Saturday's _Globe_, shows their  attitude on the question.
As to Canada's furnishing a contingent the  Government has not discussed the question for the reasons which I have  stated, reasons which, I think, must easily be understood by everyone  who understands the constitutional law on the question.
The statement  in the _Military Gazette_ published this morning is a pure invention.
This interview proves that Sir Wilfrid Laurier at that time had no intention of sending a contingent.
On the 7th October Sir Wilfrid Laurier left for Chicago, and returned to Ottawa on the 12th.
The Boer ultimatum had been given on the 9th October, was refused by Lord Milner on the 10th, and war opened on the 11th.
This turned Sir Wilfrid back.
He travelled on the train from Chicago with Mr. J. S. Willison, editor of the _Globe_, who urged him strongly to send a contingent at once.
I called to see Sir Wilfrid on his way through Toronto in order to press the matter upon him.
He had evidently made up his mind, for he told me he would send a contingent no matter whether it broke up his Government or not, that it was the right thing to do and he would do it.
He was anxious, however, about how his own people would take it, and told me that Mr. Bourassa would resign as a protest, and he seemed very sorry that it should be so.
I was very much pleased at the decision and firmness he evinced, and have always been very grateful to him for his action in this matter, as in many other things in the interest of the Empire.
On the next day, the 13th October, the Order in Council was passed.
It provided that a certain number of volunteers in units of 125 men each with a few officers, would be accepted to serve in the British army operating in South Africa, the moment they reached the coast, provided the expense of their equipment and transportation to South Africa was defrayed, either by themselves or by the Canadian Government, and the Government undertook to provide the equipment and transportation for 1,000 men.
I knew that it was the intention to send these eight units of 125 men each, as distinct units to be attached to eight different British regular infantry regiments, and that no officer of higher rank than a captain was to be sent.
I felt that our men would be swallowed up and lost, and could gain no credit under such conditions.
I therefore published in the _Globe_ of the 14th October the following letter:   The _Globe_ on Wednesday morning published in its Ottawa  correspondence a proposed scheme for a Canadian contingent for the war  in South Africa.
If the Imperial Government proposes, as the report indicates, to  enlist a number of units of one hundred and twenty-five men each, to  be attached to the British Infantry Regiments, and to be paid and  maintained at imperial expense, there can be no objection raised to  their doing it, in any way they like, and under any conditions that  may be agreed upon between the imperial authorities and the Canadians  who enlist in what will practically be British regiments.
Of course,  these units will not be a Canadian contingent, any more than were  the 40,000 Canadians who fought in the northern army during the civil  war, or the large numbers who fought in the ranks of the United States  army and navy in the late Spanish war.
A thousand Canadians may go  and fight for the Empire in the British army, but it will not be a  Canadian contingent, nor will it represent Canadian sentiment, or a  Canadian desire to aid the Empire.
For what part will the six millions  who stay at home contribute to that contingent?
If Canada sends a contingent as her share in helping the common cause,  she should send a force commanded by our own officers, and paid and  maintained by our own people.
They should feel that they represent  our country, and that the honour of all who stay at home is in their  keeping.
Men would go in such a corps for such a purpose who would  never dream of enlisting as the ordinary Tommy Atkins, in regiments  they did not know, among comrades unfamiliar, and under strange  officers.
A Canadian contingent sent to represent our militia and  country in an imperial quarrel would attract the very best of our  young men, but every officer should be a Canadian.
The slurs that have been thrown out in some quarters, that our  officers are not qualified, are not based upon fact, and are grossly  insulting to our people.
We have had over 35,000 militia for over  thirty years, we have had a Military College of the highest class  for over twenty years, a permanent corps for over fifteen years, a  number of our officers have been sent for long courses of instruction  at Aldershot, and not long since 6,000 of our militia were engaged  in a campaign of some four months' duration.
If Canada with all that  experience has not produced one man fit to command a battalion of  infantry, we are too inferior a type of fellaheen to offer assistance  to anyone.
I repudiate, however, any such idea of inferiority.
It does  not exist, and even if it did, our own Government should not admit it  until it has been clearly proven.
It has been said that our men have not had war service, and that a  lieutenant-colonel in command of a battalion in war must have war  experience.
I examined the list of imperial battalions published in  this evening's _Telegram_, as being in South Africa, or told off  to be sent there, and I find, after consulting Hart's army list,  that out of these thirty-four battalions seventeen are commanded by  lieutenant-colonels who have had war service, and the same number  by lieutenant-colonels who have never had experience of any kind in  active operations.
An examination of our militia list of the 1st April  last shows that in the seniority lists of lieutenant-colonels there  are no less than seventy-six who have the crossed swords before their  names, indicating that they have had active service.
It seems strange  that out of the seventy-six one could not be found sufficiently  qualified.
Let us send a Canadian contingent entirely our own, and at  our own cost.
Let us send the best we have, and then let us stand or  fall with what they can do on our behalf.
I think we can await the  result with confidence.
Sir Wilfrid Laurier read this letter the same evening, and wrote me at once, asking me to do nothing further on that line, but to meet him at Sir Wm.
Mulock's at ten p.m. on Monday evening, the 16th, on his arrival from Bowmanville, and he asked me to get Mr. Willison to come also.
On the Monday afternoon the evening papers published a despatch from Ottawa, saying that the British Government had agreed to change their order, and allow the contingent to go as a unit under a Canadian officer.
When I met Sir Wilfrid he told me he had received a telegram at Bowmanville to that effect, but was surprised to hear that it had got into the newspapers.
He then told me that he had cabled to England on the Saturday evening, the 14th, and had urged strongly that our men should be sent as one corps, and that it had been agreed to.
Once more I was under obligations as a Canadian to Sir Wilfrid Laurier, in his efforts to maintain the dignity of Canada.
The feeling here was that the dividing up our force into companies attached to British regiments was the idea of General Hutton, who had the regular officer's view as to the lack of capacity of colonial militia.
The three years' war which followed, with colonial forces side by side with imperial troops, pretty effectually settled the question whether the colonial levies were inferior or not to any of their comrades.
I was very much criticised by the more timid of my friends in Toronto for the action I had taken in favour of having a Canadian officer in command.
The opinion was that Colonel Otter would, as senior permanent officer, get the position, and some of the militia officers did not have a high opinion of his capacity.
The only regrettable incident connected with the Canadian contingents was the coming home of the bulk of Colonel Otter's regiment (when their term of service had expired) in spite of Lord Roberts' express request.
The other contingents stood by their colonels, notably the Canadian Mounted Rifles under Col. Lessard, who three times, at his request, postponed their return after their term of service had expired, and only went home when there were very few men left to represent the corps.
The Canadians who represented Canada, on the whole, did exceedingly well, and brought great credit to our country.
There were no Canadian surrenders, in a war where Arnold White says that there were 226 surrenders of British troops.
At the skirmish of Lilliefontein, Capt.
Cockburn, whom I had recommended to represent my old regiment, and his troop of about thirty-five men, fought and would neither retreat nor surrender until all but four were either killed or wounded.
Cockburn received the Victoria Cross for this affair.
At the last battle of the war, Hart's River, Lieut.
Bruce Carruthers and about thirty-five Canadian mounted riflemen fought until the last man was killed or wounded.
Lord Kitchener cabled to England that the battle was won principally through the brilliant gallantry of Lieut.
Bruce Carruthers and his party.
There was one circumstance in connection with this fight that was very gratifying to me.
It will be remembered that in 1890 I had been chairman of the deputation that had started the movement for raising the flag over the schools, and for holding patriotic exercises of various kinds.
This movement had spread, and during the years 1890 to 1899 there had been a wave of Imperialism moving through the country.
The boys at school in 1890 were in 1899 men of twenty to twenty-five years of age, the very men who formed our contingents.
The proof of this spirit of Imperialism which animated these men was strikingly illustrated by an incident of this fight at Hart's River.
I will quote from the _Globe_ of 19th April, 1902:   Standing alone in the face of the onrushing Boers at the battle of  Hart's River on the 31st March, every comrade dead or disabled, and  himself wounded to the death, Charles Napier Evans fired his last  cartridge and then broke his rifle over a boulder.
In the last letter thus far received by his father, Mr. James Evans,  of Port Hope, Charlie looked not without foreboding into the future.
"Before this reaches you we will probably be after De Wet.
We can only  hope for a safe and victorious trip.
Many a good man has died for  the old flag, and why should not I?
If parents had not given up their  sons, and sons had not given up themselves to the British Empire, it  would not be to-day the proud dictator of the world.
So if one or both  of us (he had a brother with him) should die, there will be no vain  regrets, for we will have done what thousands have done before us,  given our lives for a good cause."
There could not be a better sermon on Imperialism than that young man's letter to his father.
It was a very successful gathering, no less than six Cabinet Ministers and five ex-Cabinet Ministers being present besides a large number of senators and members of the House of Commons.
About the middle of April I received a cablegram from Mr. Freeman Murray, Secretary of the League in London, by order of the Council, inviting me to go to England to attend a banquet which the League was giving in London on the 30th April, and I left New York by the _Campania_ on the 19th April.
(The cablegram was urgent and I felt it a duty to go over.)
I arrived in London on Saturday evening, the 28th.
All offices were closed on Sunday, so I could see no one until Monday morning, the day of the banquet.
I went down to the offices of the League early and saw Mr. Murray, and found that there was to be a great demonstration.
There were to be three toasts besides that of the Queen.
The first the "Prince of Wales and the Royal Family," which was to be responded to by the Prince himself, now the King; the second was to "Her Majesty's Imperial Forces," to be proposed by Lord Salisbury and responded to by me; the third "The Australian Delegates," to be proposed by Mr. Chamberlain and responded to by Sir Edmund Barton, of Australia.
I saw the diagram of the tables and found that nearly six hundred of the foremost men of the Empire were to be present, including Lord Wolseley, Commander-in-Chief, Lord Lansdowne, Secretary of State for War, and several Field Marshals and Admirals of the Fleet.
Sir Robert Herbert, the chairman of the executive, was with Mr. Murray, and I demurred at once to responding to the toast of "Her Majesty's Imperial Forces" in the presence of Lord Wolseley and the other Field Marshals and Admirals.
I asked if Lord Wolseley had been spoken to about it, and the reply was that he had not, but that Lord Lansdowne had arranged that I was to do it, and it was all right, and no one would object.
I decided I would go at once and see Lord Wolseley.
Before I left, Sir Robert Herbert and Mr. Murray consulted me about the Hon.
Mr. Tarte, who was in Paris and had telegraphed that he was coming to the dinner, and wished to speak in order to make an important statement.
They were both averse to changing their arrangements, on account of pressure of time.
I urged them, however, to arrange for Mr. Tarte to speak, and the toast list was changed and an additional toast to the British Empire League was put on at the end of it, which Mr. Tarte was to propose, and to which the Duke of Devonshire, our chairman, was to respond.
I drove then at once to the War Office and saw Lord Wolseley, and told him what the arrangements were, and the instant he heard I was to reply for the Imperial Forces, he said, "Oh, that is capital, I did not know whether I might not have to reply and I was thinking it over in the train on my way to town.
I am so glad you are to do it."
I said, "Was there nothing said to you about it?
I will not be a party to anything that does not show proper respect for you."
His answer was, "There is no one I would rather see reply than you."
I asked him if I could say I had his consent and approval.
"Certainly," he replied.
When I arrived at the Hotel Cecil that evening I was warmly greeted by many old friends.
Shortly after the Prince of Wales came in, and just afterwards Lord Salisbury, who spoke to the Duke of Devonshire and the Prince of Wales, and then looking about the room he saw me and crossed over at once and shook hands with me, and chatted for a few minutes in his usual friendly manner.
As soon as he moved away several of my friends came to me and expressed surprise at the very cordial greeting he had given me.
I said, "Why should he not?"
and then they told me that he hardly ever knew or remembered anyone, and was very exclusive.
I had never thought that of him, as he had always been so kind and friendly to me.
At the table I was third to the left of the chairman, the present Prince of Wales and the Duke of Fife between us.
I had a good deal of conversation with the Prince and the Duke of Fife during the dinner.
Among other things, the Prince said to me, "Do you not feel nervous when you have to address a gathering like this?"
I said, "Not generally, sir, but I must confess I never had to tackle an outfit like this before."
He seemed much amused at my western way of putting it.
I had not known anything of what I was wanted for till that morning, so I had little time to think over what I should say.
I had during the afternoon thought out the general line of a short after-dinner speech, but when I sat down at the table and looked around the room I was impressed with the fact that I had been thrust into what was a great Imperial function, and I had to vary my plan and pitch my speech in a different key.
The King, then Prince of Wales, in responding to his health, made a very fine speech, and referred to the attempt to assassinate him, which had occurred not long before in Belgium.
Lord Salisbury then proposed "Her Majesty's Imperial Forces" and in doing so paid me a compliment that I appreciated more than any that has ever been paid me.
He ended his speech in these words: "I beg to couple with the toast the name of my friend, Colonel Denison, who has been one of the most earnest and industrious, as well as most successful supporters of the Empire for many years, as I have well and personally known."
I spoke as follows:   May it please your Royal Highness, your Grace, my Lords and Gentlemen,  and Ladies--I arrived at the offices of the League this morning, and  found to my astonishment that I was put down to respond to the toast  of the Imperial Forces.
I am, I suppose, the junior officer in this  room, but I have the consent and approval of my old commander, the  Commander-in-Chief, so that I have very great pleasure in responding  to this toast.
I am glad to be here to-night, and I thank the Council  of this League for their kindness in cabling an invitation across  the Atlantic to me to come.
I have come 3,500 miles to be with you  to-night, to show my sympathy with the cause, and to bring to you a  message from the British Empire League in Canada.
I need not refer  to what our League has done in our country, and is still doing, in  educating public opinion in favour of the great idea of the unity of  the Empire.
We have been doing many things in that cause lately.
You  know what we have done in regard to preferential trade.
What we have  done in giving advantages to the West Indian Colonies is another proof  that we are willing to put our hands in our pockets for the benefit  of our fellow-countrymen.
We Canadians are to-day paying a cent a  pound more for our sugar to help labour in the markets of the West  Indies.
We have also had a great deal to do in helping to carry out  the scheme of Mr. Henniker-Heaton for Imperial Penny Postage and in  this sense we have done all we could.
Now I want to say a few words  to-night on behalf of our League on the question of Imperial Defence.
We have thought over this thing seriously, and we see at this moment,  in looking around the world, a great many things that we cannot help  viewing with anxiety.
We see every other great nation armed to the  teeth; we see a feverish anxiety on the part of these other great  nations to increase their navies to a very considerable extent.
All  that is something which should cause us to reflect very seriously  as to our position, and do all that we can as an Empire to combine  all our forces, so that, if at any future time the blow comes, the  full force of the British Empire can strike in the swiftest and most  powerful manner possible.
We know that the Navy is the main defence of  us all, and we know what great strides are being made abroad in regard  to the navies of the different Powers, and it is our desire--and we  have educated public opinion in Canada to that point--that there shall  be a Royal Naval Reserve formed among our 70,000 hardy and vigorous  sailors.
We have got the people, Parliament, and the Government with  us, and it will only take a little time and departmental work to have  this matter carried out.
That is one point.
There is another.
We are  exceedingly anxious about your food supply.
I know a candid friend is  not always a pleasant companion, and this may be to some an unpleasant  subject, but I have come to speak to you about it.
Your food supply  depends on your Navy, and if anything should happen to prevent for a  few months the English Navy having the control of the sea, where would  you people be?
Now, we know that if the Mother Country goes down, the  Colonies might hold together, but still what could we do if the heart  of the Empire were struck?
It would be like stabbing a man to the  heart, and therefore we are anxious about your food supply because we,  as a part of this Empire, are interested in it.
Now, then, you are  putting all your eggs in one basket.
You are putting everything on  the control of the Navy, and I want to say this to you to-night--I am  again the candid friend--that you might have the absolute control of  the sea and yet, by a combination of two Powers, with an embargo on  food, you could be brought to your knees.
I ask if it is right that  things should be left like that?
Should the greatest, the wealthiest,  and the most powerful Empire in history be dependent on foreigners  for its food supply?
I shall not make any suggestions as to what  should be done, but I have been asked to urge you to give earnest  consideration to the point.
So much for that.
Now, with reference to  the contingents.
We sent our contingents to this war willingly.
We  not only did it willingly, but before the war came on our Parliament  by a unanimous vote expressed its sympathy with and approval of the  conduct of the Imperial Government, and therefore we had to stand by  it.
We have sent our men willingly--some 3,000 of them.
We would have  sent a great many more if it had been a great war, and I may tell you  that at the opening of the war we all misunderstood it.
One of our  prominent statesmen said to me, "Denison, this is only a small war,"  and Mr. Alexander McNeill, of the Canadian House of Commons, one of  the staunchest friends of the Empire said: "This is a small war, and  it is not necessary to use a steam hammer to break a nut."
Another  prominent statesman said to me after the ultimatum was issued: "If  this were a great war and the Empire in danger we should have to send  our men by the 50,000 and vote war credits by the hundred million."
When that man said that he voiced, I believe, the feelings of the  Canadian people.
We sent the contingents, and the men, as I said,  turned out willingly.
Officers resigned their commissions all over  the country and went into the ranks.
In fact in one regiment there  was only one private.
(Laughter.)
I am going to let you have that  joke; if I had finished my sentence you would not have had it.
There was one regiment in which only one private was able to get in  to the ranks of the contingent.
The others were all officers and  non-commissioned officers.
That sort of thing went on all over the  country, and although they were only militia men, although they  were only raw troops, I am proud to be able to say to-night, on the  authority of Lord Roberts' despatches, that our men have been able  to hold their own with the others.
There is one more remark I wish  to make.
The people of Canada have been struck by the extraordinary  way in which the Mother Country has entered into this war.
The manner  in which it has been done has thrilled our people with admiration.
We have seen the best blood in England spilt in this campaign.
In order to uphold the rights of one or two hundred thousand  of our fellow-colonists in one small part of the Empire.
That has  been a great object-lesson to us all.
We have seen men of wealth, of  birth, and position leave their comfortable homes by hundreds; we have  seen them leave all the luxury and ease of the greatest and finest  and highest civilisation that this world has ever seen, to undergo  dangers, trials, wounds, and in many cases death, all for this cause.
Now, this has been an object-lesson to us all in Canada.
If your  people will do that for one colony we feel you would be likely to do  it for another.
Whether you would or not I say it is a fine thing  to have an Empire to fight for that can produce such men, and it is  a proud thing for our contingents to be able to fight alongside such  comrades.
With reference still to this point about Imperial defence, I  wish to say that we Canadians are very anxious about the establishment  of all-British cables round the world, and we have tried to do our  share in regard to the Pacific cable.
We who are connected with the  League in Canada have written and spoken and done everything we could  to stir up public opinion, so that the Canadian people might have  their share in that cable, and we have been alarmed lest anything  should occur to affect adversely that project; and here let me say  that I am glad to see present to-night my fellow-countrymen from  Australia.
I congratulate them on the possibility of the federation  of their country, for we Canadians know by experience what a good  thing it has been for us, and we believe that it will be equally  good for them.
But I wish to say to them, while here to-night, that  while the establishment of the Pacific cable might have the effect  of benefiting us in a pecuniary way by cheapening rates, that has  not been the motive which has influenced people in our country.
I  for one may say that I never in my life sent a cable to Australia,  I never received one, I never saw one, and I never met a friend who  had, and on the committee of which I was one of the members I believe  that that was pretty generally the experience.
Allow me to say in  explanation of this that I live in Toronto, well inland, where there  is not any great communication with Australia, and therefore the  question of cheap rates had nothing to do with our action.
We wanted  to see an all-British cable, so that if there should be a war the man  in charge of the Navy should have the opportunity of handling that  Navy to the best advantage.
It is for that reason we Canadians want  an all-British Pacific cable, and I am called upon to ask you here  to use what influence you can, that, in any arrangements for new  cables anywhere, there shall be a provision that the Empire may buy  them at a fair price whenever it may wish, and I hope that the Empire,  with the assistance of the Colonies, may some day unite and have  their cables all over the world.
Now, with reference to the Imperial  forces, the Marquess of Salisbury did not say a great deal about the  Imperial army.
I think that I should like to say a word or two for  them to-night.
I think they have shown that in pluck and daring,  and in the courage which has carried the British people through so  much, they have been fully equal to the traditions of the past.
With  reference to the future I want to say one word.
When this war is over  I hope there will be an Imperial Conference called.
I think the moment  would be most opportune for leading men from the leading Colonies to  meet together and see on how many points they could agree.
I quite  agree with the noble Marquess in saying that we must move slowly and  along the lines of the least resistance; that we must move step by  step, slowly and carefully, as we have been doing, and not be in too  great a hurry for a written Constitution.
That is the policy we have  been advocating in our country, and it is the right one.
I am afraid  I have kept you too long.
I am glad indeed to have been here to meet  you to-night, and I am glad to see with us my friend, the Hon.
J. I.  Tarte, the first French Canadian who joined our League, now long years  ago; and if there is anything more to be said on behalf of Canada I am  sure that he will be willing to say it for me.
It will be noticed that when I said that there was one regiment in which there was only one private, the audience laughed loudly and interrupted me before I finished my sentence.
I turned the laugh on them to the evident delight of the present Prince of Wales, who turned to me beaming with amusement when I sat down and said, "You nervous!
you--why you could speak anywhere about anything."
He was evidently pleased, for when my brother, Admiral John Denison, who commanded the _Niobe_, which escorted him as far as Gibraltar when he left for Australia, met him at Gibraltar, he spoke to him at once about my speech at that dinner.
Lord Wolseley, who was sitting on my left, Lord Avebury and Sir Edmund Barton being between us, tore off a piece of a menu card and wrote on it, "My dear friend, Bravo!
Wolseley," and passed it up to me.
Everyone was very kind.
The King came and spoke to me for a few minutes as he was going out, and said he was pleased with my speech.
The Duke of Cambridge, Lord Salisbury, Lord Lansdowne, and many others spoke in friendly terms, and altogether I was well pleased that I had crossed the Atlantic to do that one piece of work for Canada and the Empire.
The accounts in the Press were very full of the idea of the importance and success of the function.
The _British Empire Review_ said:   It is unnecessary to dilate here upon the imposing features of the  great assembly which congregated in the Grand Hall of the Hotel Cecil  on 30th April.
By common consent, as our principal contemporaries bear  witness in the extracts from their leading columns, which are appended  to the full report of the speeches at the banquet printed at the end  of the present issue of the _Review_, no more memorable Imperial  Demonstration has ever been held in London.
Certainly the Executive  Committee was justified in taking the exceptional course of inviting  Colonel Denison to travel 3,500 miles in order to be present, and he  in turn can have no reason to regret his acceptance of the invitation.
Many of those present, from the highest downwards, have expressed  the opinion that, taking into consideration the occasion of the  banquet, the attendance of persons of note, the speeches, the general  excellence of all the arrangements, and the dinner itself, the event  stands unrivalled within living memory.
On the 17th May, 1900, a meeting of the Council of the League was held, principally to hear an address from me on behalf of the Canadian Branch.
I brought before the Council the resolution with which our Executive Committee had entrusted me when I was leaving:   Resolved, that the Executive Committee of the British Empire League in  Canada wishes, in view of the President's coming visit to England, to  reiterate its well-defined opinions upon certain matters of Imperial  unity.
It strongly feels the desirability of the Pacific cable  project, the importance to the Empire of some mutual tariff preference  between its various parts, the advisability of holding another  Imperial Conference to discuss matters of defence, trade, and other  interests of the Empire, and the vital necessity of encouraging the  production of a sufficient national food supply under the British flag.
I pressed all these points upon the Council in a speech which is reported in the _British Empire Review_ for June, 1900.
I had been discussing these questions and particularly the food supply with many people and found an undercurrent of feeling much stronger in that direction than on my previous visits to England, and I felt sure that if any political leader would come out and boldly advocate our policy he would get a strong support.
I knew Lord Salisbury was in full sympathy with my views, but the cold reception given to him in 1890 and 1892, when he tried to lead public opinion in that direction, had thoroughly discouraged him, and he refrained from further efforts, not because he did not feel the importance of the question, but he felt it was hopeless.
He wrote me on 1st March, 1901:   I am old enough to remember the rise of Free Trade and the contempt  with which the apprehensions of the protectionists of that day were  received, but a generation must pass before the fallacies then  proclaimed will be unlearnt.
There are too many people whose minds  were formed under their influence, and until those men have died out,  no change of policy can be expected.
Mr. Chamberlain still held back, but I felt that he would come to our policy as soon as he could see any hope of a successful movement.
I was anxious to test the public feeling, but did not see any opportunity, until I met Sir Howard Vincent about the middle of May, and he told me he was going down to Chelmsford, to deliver a lecture on "South Africa."
The meeting was organised by Major Sir Carne Rasch, who was nursing the constituency, and intending to be a candidate in the Conservative interest at the general elections, which were to come off that autumn.
Sir Howard Vincent said he would arrange that I should have half an hour to say something about Canada.
I agreed to go, and decided that I would feel the pulse of the masses on the subject of food supply, but I said nothing of this to anyone, for I felt that neither Sir Howard nor Sir Carne Rasch would wish to run any risks.
I began very cautiously but soon had the audience with me.
I was continually cheered, and went on farther and farther, until I advocated a duty on corn, or a bounty on wheat, or a bonus to farmers to keep wheat in ricks.
I had been astonished at the friendliness of the audience, but when I got to that point, Sir Carne Rasch and Sir Howard Vincent evidently became nervous, and Sir Howard whispered to me that we would have to get off in order to catch the train, and I stopped instantly.
On driving to the station I saw that both my friends were uneasy, and I said, "I hope I did not make any bad breaks"; Sir Carne said, "Oh, I think not."
I replied, "You can easily say that I am an ignorant colonial and did not know any better."
He laughed at this, but I could see he was a little nervous as to the result.
About four or five days after this I was in the lobby of the House of Commons, when Sir Carne Rasch came out of the House, and as soon as he saw me he came across to me at once, and said he was glad to see me, and that he was going to get my address from Sir Howard Vincent.
He went on to say that the people at Chelmsford had been delighted with my speech, that letters had been written to him, and he had been asked to get me to go down to Chelmsford and repeat my speech and enlarge upon it.
He said he was astonished, that the people had been discussing it ever since, and he offered to secure the largest hall in Chelmsford if I would go down, and that he would guarantee it would not hold all that would wish to come.
I was leaving in three or four days for home, and had no opportunity, and so had to decline.
A day or two afterwards, in the Mafeking demonstration, I was looking at the crowds near the Piccadilly Circus, when I heard a man say to another, "Is not that Colonel Denison?"
I knew I had seen him before, and I said, "Yes, it is; do you come from Toronto?"
"No," he replied, "I am from Chelmsford, and heard you speak there last week," and he introduced me to three friends from Chelmsford.
One was the Mayor, another the editor of the _Essex County Chronicle_.
They at once asked me if I was going down to Chelmsford again, and whether Major Rasch had seen me, and they urged me to go, telling me that the people were very anxious that I should speak there again, and that they were busily discussing the various points which I had raised.
I naturally watched for the return of the election in the following October, for I was very anxious that my friend Sir Carne Rasch should be elected.
The return for Chelmsford was Major Rasch, 4,978, H. C. S. Henry, Lib., 1,849, a majority of 3,129.
I felt then that my speech had not hurt him, or that if it had it did not matter.
This incident had an important influence upon the subsequent work of our League in Canada for several years.
The Report went on to say:   The time was never so opportune.
The public mind is full of these  Imperial questions.
Australia is now in a position to act as a unit.
Canada has long been ready.
The people of England have at last  awakened to the vastness, the importance, and future possibilities  of their great outside Empire, and posterity would never forgive the  statesmen of to-day if so favourable a chance to carry out a great  work was lost.
Your Committee consider that an Imperial Consultative  Council should be established, and that immediate steps should be  taken to thoroughly organise and combine the military and naval power  of the Empire.
During the year 1901 I was consulting with the Executive Committee, and with individual members of it from time to time, and expressed the view that we had accomplished our work in Canada, that Commercial Union had been killed, the desire for reciprocity with the States had died out, that both political parties had become alive to the importance of mutual Imperial preferential trade, and that the Canadian Government had given a preference to Great Britain and the West Indies, that penny postage had been established, Canadian contingents had been sent to fight in an Imperial quarrel, that the Pacific cable was being constructed principally through the determined action of Canada, and that I felt the whole movement in favour of Imperial Unification in the future would have to be fought out in Great Britain.
My experience in Chelmsford had convinced me that there was a strong undercurrent of feeling in Great Britain in favour of tariff reform, but that nearly everyone seemed afraid to "bell the cat" or to face the tremendous influence of the bogey of Free Trade.
I found many people quite willing to admit privately the necessity of some change, but no one ready to come out and boldly advocate tariff reform, or any kind of protection.
I said that if a few Canadians, good platform speakers, would go over to England, and make a campaign through the cities and towns, pleading with the people to unite with the colonies to consolidate and strengthen the Empire, the support they would receive would be very great, and might lead to securing the assistance of some prominent political leaders.
I was, and always have been, convinced that so many influences of every kind were working in our direction that in time our policy would necessarily be successful.
This was discussed from time to time, and it was finally decided that a deputation should go to England before the Imperial Conference, which we knew would be held at the time of the coronation in 1902, and that the deputation should advocate a concise and definite policy, easily understood, which would contain the substance of the trade system that we felt to be so necessary for the stability of the Empire.
This was crystallised into the following resolution:   That a special duty of five or ten per cent.
should be imposed at  every port in the British possessions on all foreign goods; the  proceeds to be devoted to Imperial defence, by which each part would  not only be doing its duty toward the common defence, but at the same  time be receiving a preference over the foreigner in the markets of  the Empire.
Having decided upon this point, it was considered advisable that before we went to England we should first test feeling in different centres in Canada, to make sure that the policy we were advocating was one that Canadians generally would approve.
I decided to go to New Brunswick and lay the question before a public meeting in St. John and discuss the matter with prominent men, and in that way test public opinion.
I had a very successful meeting in St. John on the 28th November, 1901, where one senator and four members of the Commons and of the local legislature spoke approvingly of the resolution, which was carried unanimously.
The Press in New Brunswick was very favourable.
The St. John _Sun_, in its leading article the next day, said:   We have no hesitation in endorsing the policy propounded by the  President of the British Empire League, and supported at last night's  meeting by all the speakers on both sides of politics and the  unanimous vote of the audience.
The article concluded in the following words:   Nor is it out of place to say that Colonel Denison's manner of  presenting the proposition was worthy of the great theme.
He is  himself intensely impressed with the solemn dignity of the subject,  which touches the destiny of our Empire, and this grave interest was  borne in on the audience, and pervaded the other speeches, even those  in which a lighter tone prevailed.
For this reason, perhaps because  most men speak better when they speak strongly, the speeches following  the address of the evening were, like Colonel Denison's itself, in  tone and quality distinctly superior to those which one usually hears  on public occasions.
The _Morning Post_, of London, and the _Naval and Military Record_ both had long articles commenting upon this meeting and approving of the spirit shown, but not speaking hopefully of the possibilities of Great Britain accepting the principle of preferential duties.
From St. John I went to Montreal, where I addressed a successful meeting on the same subject on the 30th November, 1901.
On the 24th January, 1902, I addressed a large meeting in London, Ontario, the Bishop of Huron in the chair.
The same resolution was carried unanimously, and the three newspapers--the Conservative, the Liberal, and the Independent--all united in warm approval of the policy, as did the other speakers, who were chosen equally from both sides of politics.
Some time later a meeting was organised at Owen Sound, which was addressed by Mr. Alexander McNeill, Vice-President of the League, advocating the same policy, which was unanimously endorsed.
The seventh Annual Meeting of the League at Ottawa, at which this policy was also endorsed, took place on the 20th February, 1902.
By this time the Executive Committee had become confident that they had the mass of the Canadian people behind them in their proposed policy, and steps were taken to have a deputation proceed to England to endeavour, by public meetings and otherwise, to bring the matter before the attention of the people, and if possible to inaugurate public discussion of the policy.
The following resolution was carried by the Executive Committee:   The Executive Committee of the British Empire League in Canada, having  regard to the rapid growth of national sentiment in the greater  colonies and the strong and vigorous Imperial sentiment throughout the  Empire, is of opinion that it is most important that advantage should  be taken of the coming Imperial Conference in London to secure some  definite and forward action towards the accomplishment of the objects  of the British Empire League as a whole.
The Executive Committee, with this view, requests the President of the  League in Canada to visit England soon, if possible, and advocate the  already expressed opinions of the Canadian branch by addressing public  meetings, and otherwise, as he may find expedient and proper, in order  to assist in influencing public opinion in favour of these objects.
That he also be empowered and requested to advocate that a special  duty of 5 to 10 per cent.
should be imposed at every port in the  British possessions on all foreign goods, in order to provide a fund  for Imperial Defence, which fund should be administered by a Committee  or Council in which the colonies should have representation.
The Executive Committee also expresses the hope that the Hon.
George  E. Foster, the Hon.
A copy of this resolution was sent to the head office in England, with a request that I should have an opportunity of addressing the Council of the League in April.
A favourable reply was received.
I was much impressed with the tone of their conversation; they seemed to feel that I was going upon an almost hopeless errand, but let me know how strongly they sympathised with me.
I can never forget the loyal support and assistance I have always received in all circumstances from the spirited and unselfish patriotism of the advocates of Imperialism in Canada.
The greatest satisfaction I have is to feel that for so many years I was working in a cause which rallied around it such a splendid galaxy of upright and honourable men.
Mr. Foster was not able to go to England that year, but he went the following year, and did great work in speaking through England, and in Scotland, in support of Mr. Chamberlain's policy of Tariff Reform, which was what we had been working for for so many years.
George W. Ross came over late, being delayed by the Ontario General Elections, and he supported me by a powerful and eloquent speech at the annual meeting of the League in London.
Dr. Parkin was also delayed, but he had never fully accepted our trade policy, and as negotiations opened at once between him and the Rhodes Trust to secure his services for their work, he was not able to address any meeting, so that for two months the whole burden fell upon me, and I was obliged unaided to endeavour to break the ice, and get the movement started.
To look back now it is hard to call to mind the state of affairs in England at this time.
No prominent statesman had said one word, in public, in support of mutual preferential tariffs except Lord Salisbury, and he was discouraged and disheartened by the lack of support, and at that time was in such failing health that no assistance could be expected from him.
I felt that I was facing a very hard proposition, and one almost hopeless in its prospects.
I was afraid of being ignored or simply sponged out.
I was very anxious to be attacked.
I knew if I was vehemently assailed it would be a great advantage, for I felt I had the facts and arguments, and could defeat my opponents in discussion.
I had been for years studying the question, reading constantly articles _pro_ and _con._, and had classified, organised, and indexed my material, until I felt every confidence in my cause.
I arrived in London on the 21st April, and on that morning my first stroke of good luck occurred.
The papers had just published the announcement of the Morgan combine of the Atlantic Steamship Lines.
This had positively startled the British people.
It shook them up and alarmed them, and caused them for the first time for many years to be uneasy as to their pre-eminence in mercantile marine.
They were in a mood to listen to questions as to their future prospects.
I used Morgan's action in conversation to support my view that Great Britain must follow the advice of the Prince of Wales and "wake up."
The _Daily Express_ sent a representative to interview me on the Morgan affair, and on the 25th April, 1902, it published an interview of over a column in length.
I pointed out the widespread danger of Morgan's combination if it succeeded, that the Canadian Pacific Railway might be secured, and then no other line of steamships could compete, for if the United States combine controlled the railways, they would control the freights, and so the vessels; and if they dominated the Atlantic and Pacific, the British Empire would be split in twain.
I wound up the interview by a plan to checkmate the combine, saying, "The right method is to run a competing line, tax everything the combine vessels bring into this country and let the things that the other line brings come in free."
On the 1st May the _Express_ had another interview on the same question.
On the 26th April I spoke at the banquet given to the Lacrosse Team at the Hotel Cecil, and touched upon Imperial questions, but the newspapers reported nothing.
On the 28th April Sir Gilbert Parker gave a lunch for me at the Constitutional Club, and invited several editors to meet me.
On the 30th April I attended the annual dinner of the Royal Colonial Institute, where I was assigned to respond to the toast of "The United Empire."
This was my first chance of speaking to a large audience, and it was composed of the foremost men in England interested in the Colonial Empire.
Sir George Taubman Goldie sat next to me and proposed the toast.
It came last.
An extra toast to the Houses of Parliament inserted to give Lord Halsbury, the Lord Chancellor, an opportunity to speak, made it very late when my turn came.
Sir Taubman Goldie said it was too late and he would not speak.
I felt it was too important a chance for me to allow to slip, and I said to him that I must speak for five minutes.
The next morning none of the daily papers had any report of my speech.
The _Times_ included it under the words "other toasts followed."
This was the treatment I had been most afraid of.
I knew there was no chance of doing anything if I was simply ignored.
It was not that my speech was not important, but it was late and I was a stranger.
I. N. Ford, representative of the New York _Tribune_ and the Toronto _Globe_, was present, and he at one saw the importance of the policy I propounded, and cabled to New York, and all over the States, and to Toronto a report of the dinner.
His report, in view of subsequent developments, may be reproduced:   The most interesting episode of the last twenty-four hours has been  the breath of fresh air at the Imperial function, the annual banquet  of the Royal Colonial Institute in Whitehall Rooms.
The speaking began  after nine o'clock and was perfunctory for two hours.
Lord Grey, as  chairman, opened the proceedings quietly, and there was nothing of  exceptional interest.
Henry Copeland, representing New South  Wales, suggested that the three sons of the Prince of Wales, should  have the titles of Princes of Canada, of Australia and of South  Africa, and the daughter Princess of New Zealand.
Lieut.-General  Leslie Rundle asserted that a good feeling had been brought about  between the colonial contingents and the British Army.
The Lord  Chancellor talked about the utility of Parliament.
Lord Grey paid a  tribute to the unselfish idealism of Mr. Cecil Rhodes.
It was not until eleven that real interest was created by the response  of Colonel Denison to the toast of "The United Empire."
He was only on  his feet five minutes, but he carried the representative audience of  240 colonials with him.
He then gave a summary of the speech and concluded:   Colonel Denison's policy excited murmurs of dissent at first, but was  applauded with great vigour at the close as a practical sequel to the  tax on grain and flour.
I give the verbatim report of this speech, and it will be seen that it contains the whole principle of the Tariff Reform movement which has since made such headway:   As a member of this Institute, and one who has worked most of his  life in the interests of the United Empire, I should have very great  pleasure in responding to this toast at some little length, but I must  be brief at this late hour.
This year is one of the most important  years of the history of the Empire.
We speak of the United Empire,  and although we have an Empire which in one sense is united, still in  another sense it is not a United Empire.
It is not combined in any  way, or organised for defence, and I think it is absolutely necessary  that steps should be taken at the earliest possible moment to have it  properly combined.
The coming conference of Premiers will be one of  the most important events in the history of the British race.
I am  under the impression that when this conference meets it will either  do some good work in connection with the unification of the Empire,  or it may be that either through sloth, or indolence, or lack of  appreciation of the extraordinary importance of the occasion, the  critical moment may be allowed to lapse, and we may soon see our  career as a great and powerful people approaching a close.
I  certainly hope not, but speaking as a Canadian watching closely the  trend of affairs in that country, and having had a good deal of work  in the fight we had some fifteen years ago against Commercial Union  with the United States, I tell you this is a most critical period, and  that this Empire must combine for defence and for trade.
For defence  because every great thinker and every man who has studied the subject  knows that we may have war upon us at any moment.
Take the last words  of that great statesman, Lord Dufferin, when he said that nothing,  neither a sense of justice, nor the precepts of religion, nor the  instincts of humanity, would prevent any of these foreign nations  from attacking us at the first favourable opportunity.
Why did Lord  Salisbury two years ago, at the Primrose League gathering, say that  "The whole thing may come as a wave upon us."
Is it not necessary  that we should combine the Empire both for trade and defence?
Now we  have considered this subject carefully in Canada, and held meetings  all over the country, and the proposal we wish to see adopted at this  conference--a proposal I have been asked by the British Empire League  to lay before you--is that at that conference every representative  there should agree to a proposal to put from five to ten per cent.
duty on all foreign goods at every port in every part of the Empire.
Not for Protection or Free Trade, but to form a fund for  defence.
That is why it has got to be done, and you will require  large sums of money to put the thing on a proper footing.
We want  also to combine for trade.
We want some proposal which would help to  a certain extent to protect the trade of the Empire in every part,  which would tend not only to protect trade in every part, but to stop  the merciless attacks made on the trade of this country by foreign  nations.
We have never had to face such a pitiless commercial war in  all our history.
The commercial war in the time of Napoleon was a mere  incident in actual war, but we are to-day feeling the attacks at every  turn.
I think this proposal which the Canadian people wish to see  adopted would have one other effect.
We have 400,000,000 of people in  this Empire, but only 50,000,000 of British stock and bound together  by ties of kindred, race, and blood.
The rest are satisfied to be in  our Empire.
On account of the just administration of affairs,  the freedom and liberties they enjoy under the British flag, and for  one other reason also, because of the great prestige we have hitherto  held as a great and dominant power.
The proposal we suggest would have  the effect of giving a direct trade interest to all these alien races  under our flag to-day.
I believe our good friend Mr. Seddon, of New Zealand, will soon be in  this country and will be with us on this point.
I hope our Australian  friends will be with us also, and that the people of England will be  willing to make some slight sacrifices for the purpose of holding our  great and powerful Empire together, and at the same time we also shall  be making sacrifices, and doing much more than ever before for the  common cause.
This banquet was on the 30th April.
As an indication of the interest taken in the matter in the United States, on the 5th May the Chicago _Tribune_ had a portrait of my brother, Lieut.-Colonel Septimus Denison, which they believed was mine.
Over the top were the words "Projector of plan for Union of the British Empire against the World"; at the foot of the portrait "Colonel Septimus Denison."
Several hundred representatives of the British Colonies grew wildly  enthusiastic at a banquet in London on Wednesday night, over a plan  proposed by Colonel Denison, of Toronto, for a union of Great Britain  and all its colonies for commercial defence against the rest of the  world.
Colonel Denison's scheme, as outlined in his speech, is to levy  a tariff of from five to ten per cent.
at all British and colonial  ports on all goods not from Great Britain or one of its colonies and  establish free trade within the Empire.
On the 4th May I lunched with Mr. Joseph Chamberlain, and discussed with him the policy that I was advocating.
He argued the matter with me, bringing forward any number of objections, which I answered as well as I could.
I soon came to the conclusion that he was quietly taking my measure, and testing my knowledge of the question.
I then warmed up in my arguments and put my views strongly and emphatically, and soon came to the conclusion, from a mischievous expression in his eye, that he was not as much opposed to me as his remarks would lead one to think.
When leaving I felt that although he did not say a word in support of my plan, yet he was not altogether unfavourable.
On the 5th May I met Sir Douglas Straight, editor of the _Pall Mall Gazette_, and after some conversation he suggested to Mr. Sydney Low, who was with us, to interview me on behalf of the _Pall Mall Gazette_, and a long interview appeared on the front pages of that paper on the 12th May, in which I put our views forward clearly and strongly.
After pointing out the precarious condition of Great Britain's food supply I said that we in Canada felt that it would be a sheer waste of money for us to pay for ships, troops, and coaling stations, while taking no precautions to secure adequate supplies of food, and that a preferential tax on food would help greatly to overcome the danger.
I concluded with the following words:   I do not wish to enter upon the whole economical and financial  question; but everything I have seen and read convinces me that your  industrial situation is a perilous one, that you are paying for your  imports largely out of capital, and that you are depending far too  much on the profits of the carrying trade, of which, as you have been  very forcibly reminded during the past few weeks, you cannot expect  to have a virtual monopoly much longer.
If you do not speedily make  arrangements to secure yourselves some markets, where you will be  able to deal at an advantage, you will be in a very serious position  indeed in the course of the next few years.
The opportunity of solving  at once the defensive and the industrial problem seems to us to have  arrived; and we have great hopes that British statesmen and the  British public will take advantage of it.
On the 6th May there was a special meeting of the Council of the League held in a room at the House of Commons, at which Lord Avebury presided.
It was called to hear my appeal for assistance in obtaining opportunities for placing the views of the Canadian Branch before the British people.
There were a number of prominent men present, among others the Duke of Abercorn, Earl Egerton of Tatton, Sir Walter Butler, Sir Edward Carbutt, Rt.
Lord Avebury introduced me and I put my case before them.
After I had spoken at some length Sir Charles Tupper followed, supporting me strongly.
Mr. W. H. Holland--now Sir William Holland--criticised my views from the Free Trade Manchester standpoint, and was totally opposed to me.
Mr. Talbot Baines was not favourable to my views, but thought I should have opportunities of putting them before the public.
Sir Guilford Molesworth and Sir Fred Young supported me strongly, as did Dr. Culver James and Sir John Cockburn.
I wound up the discussion, particularly replying to Sir William Holland's remarks.
Among other things Sir William Holland had said:   I might say that the trade of which I know the most, the cotton trade,  would be affected considerably by such a scheme.
If an important duty  of five or ten per cent.
were imposed on all cotton coming into this  country from territory outside the limits of the British Empire, we  should at once penalise that great industry by enhancing the cost of  the raw material by five or ten per cent., and as the cotton trade is  largely dependent on markets outside British territory, I am afraid it  might have a disastrous effect on our ability to compete in the great  neutral markets of the world, if our raw material was penalised to  that extent.
When I rose to reply, I said:   Will Mr. Holland kindly wait a few moments?
I have just a few words to  say in reply to his remarks.
He is interested in the cotton trade, and  has given us one or two ideas upon it.
With regard to cotton,  I will give you one fair warning about that.
You are engaged at this  moment--the British people are engaged--in one of the most pitiless  and merciless wars ever waged in commercial history.
Napoleon's war  was nothing to it.
The United States have made up their mind that they  are going to use you up in every quarter.
They are taking your ships  from you, and they are going to take your boot trade altogether.
I came over here with the president of their great combine, and  he explained it to me.
"We shall destroy the whole shoe trade of  England," is what he said.
Now about your cotton trade.
I want to warn  you.
Do not be surprised if before long there will be a heavy export  tax put upon cotton in the United States, because I understand that  they may likely keep it for manufacturing with themselves.
If that is  done--and it may be easily done--such a proposition as I have made of  putting a ten per cent.
duty on imports into the ports of the empire  might cause cotton to be grown in Africa, in India, in Egypt, and  in other places, and I think for the benefit of having cotton grown  inside the Empire it will be a good thing to put on the duty, because  you are not safe for a day with the United States.
They are waging war  upon us now at every turn.
Holland evidently was impressed with my remarks about the danger of the United States reducing their sale of cotton.
It was only about a month after that the public heard of the organisation of the British Cotton Supply Association, with a subscription of £50,000 to make experiments in growing cotton under the British flag.
I have always had a very high opinion of Sir Wm.
Holland ever since.
It was unanimously resolved at that meeting "to give Colonel Denison every possible facility for stating his views to Chambers of Commerce and other influential bodies without committing the League to an endorsement, and it was referred to the Executive Committee to embody this decision in a formal resolution in the name of the Council."
At a meeting of the Executive Committee held on the 15th May the resolution was passed in these words:   That while maintaining its traditional policy of neutrality in all  matters affecting tariffs and fiscal arrangements, the Council of the  League have pleasure in resolving that it will do everything in its  power to provide facilities for Colonel Denison, the distinguished  President of the League in Canada, to express publicly his views  before the Chambers of Commerce and other important bodies in this  country.
This resolution was published in the newspapers, and the action of the Council was known to the Liberal leaders.
On the 7th May I dined at the Annual Banquet of the Newspaper Society, and responded to the toast of "The Guests," where I had an admirable opportunity of bringing my proposition before a large number of editors of newspapers from all over Great Britain.
The Aberdeen _Journal_ commenting upon this dinner said:--   Perhaps the most interesting speech of the evening was the last one.
It was delivered by Colonel Denison, a Canadian, and President of the  Empire League in Canada.
He stated that he had been sent over to this  country to do what he could to promote a movement for the defence of  the Empire, and indicated that one of the proposals to be discussed  at the Colonial Conference at the coronation would be one to impose  a duty on foreign imports at every port in the Empire, in order to  raise an Imperial Defence Fund common to the whole Empire.
He said the  duty might be 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 per cent.
There was one exclamation  of dissent when this proposal was mentioned, but Colonel Denison's  breezy, confident manner, and evidently strong conviction on the  subject, excited general sympathy.
Lord Tweedmouth's attitude during  the Colonel's speech, as it may be described, suggesting an Imperial  war tax, was rather quizzical than sympathetic.
By this time the newspapers were beginning to notice my work.
Fortunately for me about the same time Mr. Seddon had been speaking on similar lines in South Africa, and Sir Wilfrid Laurier also in the Canadian House of Commons.
This alarmed the Liberal party, and the _Manchester Guardian_ began to criticise and find fault with me to my great satisfaction, for I knew I could stand anything better than being ignored.
A friend of mine in the Liberal ranks told me about this time that the leading Liberals were in a great state of anxiety at my work.
They believed, he said, that Chamberlain, Seddon, and Sir Wilfrid Laurier had all agreed that the scheme was to be put through at the Imperial Conference, and that I had come over as an advance agent, to break the ice, to open the discussion, and prepare the way.
I evaded making any definite reply to this suggestion, jokingly saying that I was not surprised to hear that they were anxious.
I had another hint that the Liberal party purposed arranging for a great meeting at Leeds, at which Lord Rosebery was to speak, and a direct effort made to rally the whole Liberal party together, under the banner of Free Trade, as against the proposed corn tax, and the preferential arrangements with the colonies, I thought it desirable that I should have a talk with Lord Rosebery at once, and wrote asking him for an interview.
He invited me to lunch the next day, the 8th May.
There was no one present but his son and his secretary, and I appealed to him earnestly, appealed to his sympathy with Imperialism, and to his services to Imperial Federation, and urged him to assist me in my work.
I pointed out the dangers of the precarious food supply, and the disintegrating influences that might break up the Empire, and put my case as clearly as possible.
He seemed to get more and more serious as he saw all the arguments on that side, and when I was leaving I said to him; "It is too bad of me to come and unload all my gloomy forebodings upon you."
His reply was, "I share a great many of them with you."
I knew then, as I knew at the meeting in 1890, that at heart he was a warm Imperialist, but is terribly hampered and embarrassed by his party affiliations.
The meeting took place at Leeds on the 30th May.
In his speech he made two or three remarks which showed he was not as opposed to my policy as I expected.
In reference to the corn tax he said:   Not another acre of wheat, we were told by one Minister, would be  planted in consequence of this tax, which removed, to my mind, the  sole inducement to vote for it, for if more of our country could be  placed under wheat it would solve some of the difficulties connected  with the land.
Again he said:   But there is a much graver issue connected with this corn tax--an  issue which has, in reality, only recently been imported into the  discussion.
It is, I think, quite clear from the last speech of  the Colonial Secretary, that it is intended as a prelude to a sort  of Zollverein or Customs Union throughout the British Empire.
Now,  speaking for myself, I cannot summarily dismiss any proposal for the  closer union of the Empire, because it has been the ideal of more than  the last twenty years of my life (hear, hear), an ideal of which I  spoke to you at Leeds when I was last here.
I do not say that Free  Trade is a fetish, a religious dogma, which must be accepted and  applied on all occasions without consideration or reservation.
I  do not know, my mind is open, and I shall wait to hear.
His speech was more friendly than I expected, although some of his party objected to an "open mind."
Before the Leeds meeting the Liberals held a meeting in Scotland, at Aberdeen, on the 20th May, where the Rt.
James Bryce made a vigorous speech against the corn tax, which it was believed was being put on preparatory for the Imperial Conference.
On the 23rd May I addressed the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce under the chairmanship of its President, Sir Alfred Jones, who treated me with the most unbounded hospitality.
The meeting was very large and successful, and although my views aroused criticism and were objected to by some speakers, I had a chance to reply in acknowledging a vote of thanks, and as I had the strongest arguments I had little difficulty in effectively answering objections.
The _Westminster Gazette_ of the 21st May, the day before I went to Liverpool, had the following article:   Mr. Bryce stated the case against the bread tax with admirable point  and force in a speech last night at Aberdeen.
He dealt with its  protective aspect, and the part it seemed destined to play in helping  on an Imperial Zollverein, and had an excellent passage as to the  effect of the tax on the very poor: he said:   And when you get lower still, when you approach that large section  of our people--in many places 30 per cent.
of the population--which  lives on the verge of want, it becomes a crushing burden, which  means reduced subsistence, frequent hunger, weakness of body, and  susceptibility to disease.
The poor man suffers not merely because his  margin is so small that the least addition to price tells, but because  he can only afford the simplest and cheapest kinds of food.
Bread to  him is not only an article of first necessity, but of last necessity,  etc.
The comment, "He dealt with its protective aspect and the part it seemed destined to play in helping on an Imperial Zollverein," shows the alarm in the Liberal ranks.
One of the speakers at the Liverpool meeting, who objected to my arguments, spoke of the marvellous prosperity of Great Britain, all due, as he said, to Free Trade.
In my reply I used with great effect this extract from Mr. Bryce's speech, and said that if about 8_d._ per head for a whole year meant to 30 per cent.
of the population "a crushing burden, which means reduced subsistence, frequent hunger, weakness of body, susceptibility to disease," I could not see that it could be called a prosperous country.
I said I do not believe that gentleman ever saw a prosperous country.
Let him come to the protectionist United States of America, or to protectionist Canada, and he will see countries where there is hardly a soul who does not spend at least 8_d._ a week on pleasure or amusement.
This was apparently an unanswerable retort.
I found this paragraph of Mr. Bryce's very useful on more occasions than one.
I was told some five months after I had returned home, by one of the newspaper men who visited Canada at that time, that he had heard, on undoubted authority, that Mr. Joseph Chamberlain had privately asked Sir Alfred Jones to get up a meeting, and invite me to go down and address it.
The result must have been satisfactory, for the meeting was much more successful than I had any hope for.
I think Mr. Chamberlain's part leaked out and still further alarmed the Liberals, and still more aided me.
The Liverpool papers gave good reports of the meeting, and the editorial comments of two of them were not unfavourable, while one was opposed to me.
The _Courier_ of the 24th May said:   Now Canada proposes--and no doubt she will not be alone--that the  Empire as a whole accept this challenge.
Colonel Denison suggests  that a five per cent.
tariff should be laid on foreign goods in every  part of the Empire, and that the money be ear-marked for the defence.
It is, of course, premature to discuss details, but the final words  of the Canadian Imperialist deserve the most earnest attention.
He  shows that Mr. Chamberlain has not misread the signs in saying that  an opportunity of closer union is about to be offered, and a chance  given, perhaps once for all, of keeping British trade in British  hands.
If the occasion should be rejected, fair warning is given  that the elements of disintegration will inevitably begin to operate  among the colonies thus flouted, disappointed, and rebuffed.
But we  are asked to remember what Mr. Bryce says as to the percentage of the  population always on the verge of want, and to whom an important duty  would be fatal.
They have not this terrible dead-weight in Canada, and  neither have they anything of the sort in the United States.
Is it  not rational to suggest that this vast proportion of the population,  ever ready to be submerged, is a result not of dear commodities, but  of restricted production.
On the score of mere cheapness there is  assuredly little to complain of.
The biggest and cheapest loaf costs  something, and its price has to be earned.
The question is, Are we to  face this commercial struggle alone and unarmed, or are we to unite  with the daughter nations in securing a not dubious victory?
On the 13th May, ten days before the meeting in Liverpool, I was dining at Lord Lansdowne's at a dinner given to Count Matsugata, formerly Prime Minister of Japan.
The Premier and five Cabinet Ministers, Lord Roberts, the Duke of Abercorn, and several others were present.
I was seated between Mr. Chamberlain and Lord George Hamilton.
I took advantage of the opportunity to discuss our policy with Mr. Chamberlain, and pressed it as earnestly as I could put it, and we had a long conversation.
I pleaded with him to help us, that I was still afraid of reciprocity with the United States, and that I felt we were drifting, drifting, and that every year made it worse.
Whether my remarks had any weight on him or not I cannot say.
I think he had long been privately on our side, but anyway, three days after he made a speech in Birmingham, which was the most hopeful thing that had happened in all our struggle.
In that speech he said:   "The position of this country is not one without anxiety to statesmen  and careful observers.
Political jealousy, commercial rivalry, more  serious than anything we have yet had, the pressure of hostile  tariffs, the pressure of bounties, the pressure of subsidies, it is  all becoming more weighty and more apparent.
What is the object of this system adopted by countries which, at all  events, are very prosperous themselves--countries like Germany and  other large Continental States?
What is the object of all this policy  of bounties and subsidies?
It is admitted--there is no secret about  it--the intention is to shut out this country as far as possible  from all profitable trade with those foreign States, and at the  same time to enable those foreign States to undersell us in British  markets.
That is the policy, and we see that it is assuming a great  development, that old ideas of trade and free competition have  changed.
We are face to face with great combinations, with enormous  trusts, having behind them gigantic wealth.
Even the industries and  commerce which we thought to be peculiarly our own, even those are in  danger.
It is quite impossible that these new methods of competition  can be met by adherence to old and antiquated methods which were  perfectly right at the time at which they were developed.
At the present moment the Empire is being attacked on all sides, and  in our isolation we must look to ourselves.
We must draw closer our  internal relations, the ties of sentiment, the ties of sympathy--yes,  and the ties of interest.
If by adherence to economic pedantry, to  old shibboleths, we are to lose opportunities of closer union which  are offered us by our Colonies; if we are to put aside occasions now  within our grasp; if we do not take every chance in our power to keep  British trade in British hands, I am certain that we shall deserve the  disasters which will infallibly come upon us.
This was the first public utterance of Mr. Chamberlain, in which he endorsed in general terms the policy I was advocating.
In the remarks I have quoted, it will be seen that he endorsed the salient points of my five minutes' speech a fortnight before at the Royal Colonial Institute.
Political jealousy, commercial rivalry, the pitiless commercial war, the ties of sentiment, the ties of interest, the keeping of British trade in British hands, etc.
Nothing inspirited me so much as this speech.
I had preserved as a profound secret Mr. Chamberlain's promise to me in 1890 that he would study up the question, and, if he came to the conclusion it would be a good thing for our Empire, that he would take it up.
I had kept silent waiting for twelve years, until I read that speech on the morning of the 17th May, and I then told my wife the story of the interview in 1890, for I felt he had adopted the policy.
The _Daily News_, in two articles on the 22nd and 24th May, made an attack on Mr. Chamberlain and me, and found fault also with the British Empire League for giving me any countenance, and strongly criticised our policy.
The first article was entitled "The Empire Wreckers."
I was delighted to see these articles, as well as others, in the _Westminster Gazette_, the _Manchester Guardian_, and other Liberal papers.
I saw that my greatest difficulty had been overcome, and that I was not to be ignored, but that I was likely to succeed in getting the whole matter thrown into the arena for public discussion.
After quoting the proposition I was advocating in full, the _Daily News_ went on to say:   We leave to others the task of finding the appropriate adjectives for  this composition, but Colonel Denison will forgive us if we observe  that there is a certain inconvenience in conducting a campaign of this  kind during the coronation festivities.
We have no notion whether he  is acting as the advance agent of Mr. Seddon and others, whose views  on tariff preferences are of an extreme character, nor do we know  how far he speaks as the representative of his fellow-colonists.
But  he and those who are acting with him must surely see that this is  not the time for launching a campaign which is bound to give rise to  differences, and possibly to heated differences.
Everyone is anxious  to give a cordial welcome to the visitors who will be coming to our  shores next month, and nothing would be more unfortunate than to find  ourselves involved in a dispute about preferences and tariffs with our  own people.
There can be no doubt, however, that Mr. Chamberlain is the person  primarily responsible for these proceedings, and it is with him that  the Chambers of Commerce will have to deal if they wish to call their  souls and their trade their own much longer.
Ever since he came into  office the master motive in Mr. Chamberlain's mind has been to put the  Empire on a cash basis, to run it frankly as a commercial venture, and  to occupy the position of managing director of the concern .
From the standpoint of national trade and Imperial security it is  the maddest scheme that was ever offered to a country as a policy.
It ignores the fact that we do four times as much trade with foreign  countries as with our Colonies and Dependencies, and that it ties our  hands in our fiscal arrangements, and to all intents and purposes  constitutes our Colonies as the predominant partner.
Who would have  thought that it would be necessary at this time of day to do battle  against such midsummer madness?
We repeat that if Mr. Chamberlain is  allowed his way, and the British Empire comes to stand for starvation,  misery, and loss of economic freedom for the mother country, the  Empire will soon become a thing of the past.
On the 24th May, two days later, it returned to the attack on similar lines.
I saw my opening and promptly seized it.
I wrote the following letter to the _News_, which they were fair enough to publish in full with an editorial note attached.
Will you  kindly allow me to bring one or two points before your readers in  defence of my action?
The British Empire League here has not adopted our views, but has  maintained a position of neutrality, being only willing to show to  the Canadian Branch the courtesy of giving facilities for bringing  its views forward.
I have spoken already at four large banquets, and  to the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce, without the British Empire  League having had anything to do with the matter, either directly or  indirectly.
You speak of all that Free Trade has done for this country, the  priceless boons, the carrying trade of the world, increased commercial  relations with other nations, etc.
I wish in a few words to point out  why the Canadians are anxious about the present state of affairs in  the interests of the whole Empire, in which our fate as a people is  inextricably involved.
We see every nation in the world armed to the teeth, the great  nations increasing their navies with feverish anxiety.
We see that you  are alarmed in this country, for your naval expenditure has almost  doubled in the last fifteen or twenty years.
If war is out of the  question this great expenditure is useless.
We see that the United Kingdom which once grew 17,000,000 quarters  of wheat, now produces about 6,500,000 quarters.
We see that a  combination of two Powers with an embargo on food would bring you to  your knees in a few months, and compel you to surrender, and perhaps  pull us down also as a people in the general smash of the Empire  which might ensue.
We know that our Empire cannot be either a free,  independent, or great Power, until it is self-sustaining, and has its  food grown on its own soil, and in the hands of its own people.
We see a great Empire with great possessions, with resources  unparalleled, with possibilities of future strength and prosperity  almost beyond imagination; with no organisation, no combination, no  complete system of defence: and this in the face of what you admit to  be a possibility of the dangers of war.
We see a commercial war going on of the most extreme type--many  nations seemingly organising all their forces to injure the trade  of Great Britain.
We see that your export trade for the ten years  1881-1890 amounted to £2,343,000,000, while in the following ten  years, 1891-1900, it had only increased to £2,398,000,000, or an  increase of £55,000,000 in the ten years.
But the exports of coal in  the first ten years amounted to £125,000,000, in the last ten years to  £210,000,000--an increase of £85,000,000; which makes the exports of  manufactured goods less by £30,000,000 during the years 1891-1900 than  during the previous ten years, for export of coal is only a sale of  national assets or capital.
We see that while your trade is stationary at less profits,  foreign nations are increasing theirs enormously.
German exports in  1895 amounted to £171,203,000, in 1901 to £237,970,000.
The United  States in 1871 exported about £90,000,000, in 1901 about £300,000,000  (1,487,764,991 dollars).
While your trade is in a weak condition, we  see also the carrying trade passing into the hands of our rivals.
The  Morgan combine will control the North Atlantic trade if something is  not done.
It will fix the rates of freight, and, as a great portion  of your food comes from the United States, they can make the British  people pay the extra rates which will enable them to carry American  manufactures of all kinds at the smallest cost, and so deprive your  workmen of their employment and wages at the cost to themselves of  dearer food.
Canadians have seen the difficulty, and have given this country a  preference of one-third the duty in their markets without any return  or _quid pro quo_.
We have contributed to an all British cable to  Australia for Imperial reasons.
I advocated at Liverpool a large  tariff on wheat in the United Kingdom against everyone, including  Canada.
I advocated a tariff of five to ten per cent.
on all foreign  goods at every port in the Empire to raise a fund for the common  defence, and to combine the Empire for trade.
We in Canada do not  require this change if you do not.
We are prosperous; our exports  are mounting up by leaps and bounds; the balance of trade is in our  favour: but we are in the Empire; we have made up our minds to stand  by it.
We have spent the lives of our young men, and our money, in  that cause in the past.
When, therefore, we see your manufactures  going down, your export trade barely holding its own in spite of a  great increase of population, your carrying trade slipping from your  hands, your agricultural interests being destroyed, three quarters of  Ireland disloyal, principally because their farming has been ruined by  what must seem a false policy to them, is it any wonder that we should  wish to appeal to you to do something?
Is it not only fair that you  should listen to us, and if we can combine in any way to defend our  Empire from foreign aggression, either in war or in trade, should we  not all endeavour to do so?
_President British Empire League in Canada._   [The picture which Colonel Denison paints in such gloomy colours is  unhappily true in a large degree.
But the remedy is not to be found  in impoverishing the people, increasing the price of the necessities  of life, stopping the current of Free Trade through our markets, and  establishing the principle of scarcity and dearness in the place  of abundance and cheapness.
Such a remedy would simply hasten the  catastrophe that Colonel Denison foreshadows.--ED.
That is capital, how the editor must have grudged printing it."
I spoke at the Canada Club dinner on the 8th May in response to the toast of "The Dominion of Canada," and at the Colonial Club dinner on the 28th May in response to the toast of "The Empire."
On the 2nd June I addressed the Chamber of Commerce at Tunbridge Wells.
On the 4th June I addressed a large meeting in Glasgow, the Lord Provost in the chair.
On the 5th June another in Paisley, and on the 6th June I addressed a joint meeting of the Edinburgh and Leith Chambers of Commerce in Edinburgh.
On the 5th June the Glasgow _Herald_ had an article criticising my speech.
It gave me an opportunity which I used by sending them a letter which they published the next day, the 6th.
The same issue of the _Herald_ had an article referring to my letter.
To my gratification it closed with these words:   The question remains an open one whether, when the Colonies are  prepared to accept some of the burdens of the Empire, we should accord  them preferential treatment in respect of products in which they  compete with foreigners.
I have already referred to the uneasiness and anxiety among the Liberals about my mission, and in addition to Mr. Bryce's speech in Aberdeen a large meeting was held in Edinburgh on the 8th June, where the Rt.
John Morley spoke in reply to my speeches in Scotland.
Among other things he said:   You have got a gentleman now, I observe, perambulating Scotland--I  am sure in perfectly good faith--I have not a word to say against  it--perambulating Scotland on this subject, and it will be the  subject, depend upon it, because it is in the hands of a very  powerful and tenacious Statesman.
Therefore excuse me if I point  out a fifth broad effect.
On the chances of some increase in your  relatively small colonial trade, you are going to derange, dislodge,  and dislocate all your immense foreign trade.
And he also said that it meant the abandonment of Free Trade, and "would overthrow the very system that has placed us in the unexampled position of power and strength and wealth."
On the 11th June I addressed the Chamber of Commerce of Bristol, and my meeting attracted considerable attention from the local newspapers.
The _Western Daily Press_ had on the morning of the meeting a long and quite friendly article, bespeaking earnest attention to my address, even if I laid down "lines of fiscal policy along which the majority may be reluctant to travel."
The Bristol _Mercury_ gave a very full report of the meeting and of the speeches, and had a long article discussing the proposition from a strong Free Trade and hostile point of view.
On the 10th June in the House of Commons my work caused a passing notice.
After I had left Canada the Executive Committee of the League in Canada published in pamphlet form a report of the Annual Meeting of the League in Canada containing my Presidential Address in moving the adoption of the Annual Report, and they had an extra quantity printed and sent a copy to every member of the House of Lords and the House of Commons.
On the discussion of the Finance Bill in the House of Commons on the 10th June, Sir W. Harcourt, after saying that the Colonies could only join the mother country on the basis of protection, went on to say: "I received the other day the Manifesto of the Canadian Imperial League, which seems to be a very authoritative document, containing, as it does, the principal names in Canada, and which I would ask the committee to examine in relation to the Budget.
The first article of the constitution of the League is thus laid down: 'To advocate a trade policy between Great Britain and her Colonies, by means of which discrimination in the exchange of natural and manufactured products will be made in favour of one another and against foreign countries.'
Of course, that is the only basis on which the Colonies will deal with us.
If they give up their preferential duties against us, they will expect us to institute preferential duties against other nations.
In the annual report of the Executive Committee of this British Imperial League, dated February 1, 1902--months before the introduction of the present Budget--we learn that at its meeting, which was held at Toronto, the following resolution was adopted: 'Resolved, that this meeting is of opinion that a special duty of 5 to 10 per cent.
should be imposed at every port in the British possessions on all foreign goods'; and we are told, further, that the proceeds are to be devoted to Imperial defence.
But I come to the speech made by the president of the League, which bears particularly on the Budget.
He said:   "New methods of taxation are absolutely necessary in Great Britain,  and there is no difficulty in the way except the over confidence  against which Kipling writes, and the strong prejudice in the English  mind against taxing wheat.
It is a remarkable thing that two months  after this declaration was made we have, for the first time, a tax  imposed upon wheat.
The joint action of the poet and the financier  has overcome the prejudice in the English mind against taxing  wheat; then we are to have this duty of 10 per cent.
on all food  introduced into this country against the foreigners, and the whole  thing is accomplished.
I say that that is a policy of pure and simple  protection.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer yesterday disavowed any  intention of adopting this policy of universal duties to be levied  upon all foreign goods.
He said we are to proceed on the principles of  free trade.
But he introduced a sentence that something may be done in  that direction.
A great deal of doubt has been raised in reference to  that sentence.
"Mr. Austen Chamberlain said the right hon.
gentleman the member  for West Monmouth had adopted a remarkable line of argument.
He had  produced a pamphlet containing the report of an executive committee of  a private association in Canada, and had referred to that document as  if he could find in it an official explanation of the intentions and  policy of His Majesty's Government.
Harcourt.--I quoted it as the view to be presented by the  Canadian Government.
I believe I am perfectly justified in that  statement.
"Mr. Austen Chamberlain said he thought the right hon.
gentleman had  gone a good deal further than that.
The views of the association were  entitled to the respect which they commanded on their merits, and for  the ability with which they were put forth; but they were not binding  on the Canadian Cabinet, still less on the Government of this country.
It was rather a far-fetched suggestion that in such a report as that  was to be found the basis of the action which His Majesty's Government  were now proposing.
As a matter of fact the report appeared two  months before the tax.
Allusion had been made to a speech delivered  by his right hon.
friend the Colonial Secretary at Birmingham.
But  in that speech the Colonial Secretary was commenting on a speech  made by the leader of the Opposition.
He was not arguing in favour  of preferential relations, but he was refusing to be deterred from  proposing a tax which he believed to be good on its merits merely  because it might be used, if the people of this country so willed, to  draw closer the ties between the Motherland and the Colonies.
That  was a declaration which was emphasised by his right hon.
friend the  Chancellor of the Exchequer on Monday.
The whole question between  the Opposition and the Government now was that hon.
and right hon.
gentlemen opposite wished to extort from the Government at this stage  a declaration that in no circumstances and at no time would they  consent to preferential arrangements with the Colonies.
He thought  it would be a strange proceeding if, before learning authoritatively  what the Prime Ministers of the great self-governing Colonies intended  to propose, before learning the arguments with which those Ministers  would support their propositions, the Government were to slam the door  in their faces and solemnly declare that they would not listen to any  arguments on the subject.
That would not be a very friendly act.
It  would not be courteous in dealing with strangers, and it would not be  decent in dealing with our kinsmen."
The final meeting of my campaign was at the London Chamber of Commerce on the 13th June.
Mr. Morley had spoken at Edinburgh on the 8th of June, and had said generally that the policy I was advocating was contrary to the principles of Free Trade under which England had built up her wonderful prosperity, had maintained it for years, and which was the foundation of Great Britain's present great prosperity.
I had been urged very strongly by all my friends to be very cautious not to refer directly to either Free Trade or Protection.
I was told that the feeling in favour of Free Trade was so strong, that it would be unwise to refer to it in set terms, and I was advised simply to argue for the war tax of 5 to 10 per cent.
to raise a defence fund.
Up to this time I had followed this advice, but when Mr. Morley attacked me, and raised the question, I felt that the time had arrived for me to come out boldly and in clear and unmistakable terms.
I found in my movement about the country that there was much more feeling in favour of Protection than anyone believed.
I therefore made up my mind to take advantage of the meeting of the London Chamber of Commerce to make a direct and vehement attack on Free Trade in order to test feeling in that centre.
I carefully prepared as strong a speech as I could arrange, although I kept my own counsel as to my intentions.
I decided to make my address a direct reply to the Rt.
John Morley and to use his attack upon me as my excuse for criticising Free Trade in hostile terms.
*       *       *       *       *  The room was crowded, with a number of prominent men present.
I referred to Mr. Morley's remarks and said that I took issue with him, and that I denied that Free Trade was the cause of Great Britain's progress.
I said her position was established under a system of protection, that it was maintained by a protection of a different kind for years, and that now she was not prosperous.
I gave a great many figures, and traced the trade returns at intervals from 1805 until the year 1901, and in reply to Mr. Morley's statement of the wonderful prosperity of Great Britain I repeated the argument I used at Liverpool, and quoted again Mr. Bryce's statement about the crushing burden the 1s.
a quarter on wheat would be on about 30 per cent.
of the population.
When I had finished, Lord Charles Beresford made a speech that was quite friendly to my proposition, saying, "that the time had arrived when we had to do something to bind the Mother Country and the Colonies more closely together, and to do something also by which we might mutually benefit by the trade of the Empire, in view of the enormous competition directed against us by the rest of the world."
Sir Guilford Molesworth and Mr. Ernest E. Williams then spoke strongly supporting me.
They were followed by Mr. Faithfull Begg, who made a short but remarkably clever speech.
He began by saying, "Is this the London Chamber of Commerce?
Can I believe my eyes and ears?
I have sat here and listened to what I am satisfied was the strongest attack upon Free Trade that has been heard in these walls in two generations, and in an open discussion no one has said a word in defence of the old policy.
I was a Free Trader and I can no longer support the principle, but will no one say a word in defence of the old cause?"
This taunt brought up a Mr. Pascoe, who used a number of stock arguments of the Cobden Club school.
General Laurie, Admiral Sir Dalrymple Hay, Sir S. B. Boulton, and the Chairman, Sir Fortescue Flannery, then followed in speeches distinctly favourable to my proposition, and the meeting closed.
The effect of this meeting cannot be better shown than in the editorial comments of the _Financial News_ of the next day, the 14th June, 1902:   It was indeed a remarkable gathering which assembled at the London  Chamber of Commerce yesterday to hear Colonel Denison speak upon the  National Food Supply and cognate trade questions; and the essential  feature of the meeting--more essential if Colonel Denison will  allow us to say so, even than his own speech--was that to which  Mr. Faithfull Begg drew attention when he announced his surprise  that in a discussion upon Free Trade _versus_ Protection, no one, in  that erstwhile typical house of Free Trade, stood up to champion the  old cause.
Most of those present were in Mr. Faithfull Begg's own  position; they had recently been forced by the logic of events, from  acquiescence in or championship of Free Trade, into a conviction that  it would no longer do.
True, Mr. Faithfull Begg's challenge brought  forth a solitary advocate of the discredited philosophy; a young man  to whom the meeting listened with obvious impatience; for as General  Laurie said, every one of his points had been answered in advance by  the lecturer, and the quality of his arguments might be gathered from  the fact, that among them was an assertion that, as an explanation  of our adverse trade balance there was no question as to there being  anything in the nature of an export of securities in progress!
That  this should have been the only voice raised upon the Free Trade side  would be a mightily significant circumstance in any gathering of  business men; but to those who are familiar with the London Chamber  even in its recent history, the significance is greatly heightened.
For a body professedly independent, there was, until the other day, no  association in England (unless it be the Royal Statistical Society)  more thoroughly and openly upon the Free Trade side in the economic  controversy.
With the surrender of the London Chamber of Commerce it  is really time to dictate conditions of peace.
This was a conclusion to my campaign far beyond my most sanguine expectations.
It was a coincidence that about the time I concluded my campaign at this successful meeting, Dr. Fred W. Borden, Minister of Militia of Canada, who had lately arrived in England, in an interview with Mr.
I. N. Ford, representative of the New York _Tribune_, stated that I represented nobody's views except my own, and pretended that he did not know of me even by name, until Mr. Ford let him understand that he was too well informed for that to be accepted.
In an interview with one of the London newspapers he also spoke in a hostile manner of me and my views.
As he had been quite friendly to me personally when we had met a day or two before, I was at a loss to account for his action.
After consideration, I came to the conclusion that the Canadian Government had taken up some new position upon the question of preferential trade, and that I was wrong in my previous belief that I was working directly in their interests and in accordance with their views in a general way.
Mr. Ford telegraphed on the night of the meeting to his various papers across the Atlantic, the following account of my concluding words at the London Chamber of Commerce:   Colonel Denison closed his series of addresses in the United Kingdom  on a tariff for Imperial Defence by a speech before the London Chamber  of Commerce in which he announced that he represented the British  Empire League in Canada, and had accomplished his purpose.
This  had been to raise the question of a British tariff for defence and  business.
The subject had been discussed in Parliament, and had been  taken up by the Press throughout the Kingdom.
The Dominion Ministers  would be in England next week, and the responsibility for carrying the  question into the Imperial Conference or dropping it altogether would  be theirs not his.
When I sailed for home Mr. Ford cabled:   Colonel Denison will sail for Montreal to-day.
He has gone so far  and so fast in presenting the plans of the British Empire League of  Canada that neither Imperialist nor colonial has been able to keep  abreast with him.
His views on a war tax around the Empire are not  considered practicable by the Canadian Ministers, but the energy with  which he has forced the business side of Imperial Federation upon  public attention here, is generally recognised.
The Annual General Meeting of the British Empire League was held on the 7th July, where the Hon.
George W. Ross and I represented the Canadian Branch.
I moved a resolution which Mr. Ross seconded.
I spoke as follows:   Your Grace, my Lords, Ladies, and Gentlemen,--I shall only occupy two  or three minutes of your time, as I am fortunate to have with me one  of the very best and most active members of our League, the Prime  Minister of Ontario.
I am here at this moment under a resolution of  the League in Canada which reads as follows:   "That he also be empowered and requested to advocate that a special  duty of 5 to 10 per cent.
be imposed at every port in the British  possessions on all foreign goods in order to provide a fund for  Imperial Defence, which fund should be administered by a committee or  council in which the Colonies should have representation."
That resolution I need not tell you is one which this League did not  feel disposed to endorse because the League had held itself open, and  I wish to thank the President, the Council, and the Members of this  League for the broad-minded liberality and generosity with which they  enabled me to speak, and say what we Canadians wished to lay before  the people of this country.
I thank this League for its courtesy, and  for the broad-minded spirit in which it was done, more particularly as  I happen to know that the well-considered resolution adopted by the  Executive Committee was drafted by probably one of the most vehement  opponents of my policy.
That broad-minded spirit I have seen all over  England and I wish publicly, as I am going away in a day or two, to  express my thanks for that British spirit which allows such free  discussion.
I shall only take one or two minutes more because I wish Mr. Ross to  have an opportunity of speaking at greater length.
I have listened  with a great deal of attention to what our noble President has said  in his speech with respect to three questions, of defence, commercial  relations, and political relations, and if you think of it, we have  combined all three in these two lines: "A duty in order to provide  a fund for Imperial Defence, which fund should be administered by a  committee."
The duty helps all questions of commercial relations,  helps your trade, helps your food supplies, and it also furnishes a  fund for defence, and provision is made for a committee to administer  the political relations.
The whole thing can be done by an adaptation  of that resolution.
As to the question of defence, I wish to say that  we Canadians are in favour of any method that may be devised to defend  this Empire, but we know that no system of defence can be made worth  a snap of the finger that does not secure the protection of the food  supplies of this Mother Country, and yet you persist in spending on  ships, troops, fortification, on coaling stations on Naval Reserves,  on everything but food, the most important of all.
I urge you to do  all you can not only to make your food supply safe, but also to save  your trade, your merchant shipping, and to put all these things in a  safe position.
Mr. Ross followed me with a very able and powerful speech in which he expressed the views of the Canadian League with great eloquence and vigour.
On the 17th June, a letter from Sir Robert Giffen appeared in the London _Times_ severely criticising the policy I was advocating.
As a great statistician and Free Trader, and formerly Secretary of the Government Board of Trade, he was considered the ablest expert on the subject and his name carried great weight.
His objections were in substance:   First, that under such a system at 10 per cent., the United Kingdom  would pay £41,000,000 annually, and the colonies but £3,500,000, of  which Canada and Newfoundland would contribute £2,400,000, whereas on  the basis of population the Colonies are one quarter of the United  Kingdom.
Second, the effect of such a tax would be infinite disaster to the  trade of the United Kingdom, by raising the cost of raw material and  by requiring harassing regulations in regard to the entrepot trade.
Third, the increase of existing duties in the Colonies by 10 per cent.
would effect no such injury to their trade as the substitution of  duties for the Free Trade system of the United Kingdom.
Fourth, the duty on foreign goods entering the United Kingdom and  preference given to colonial goods, would increase the price for  colonial goods imported in the United Kingdom by £11,000,000, and the  Colonies would thus gain much more than their contribution.
Fifth, the difficulty in arranging bonding privileges in such free  ports as Singapore and Hong Kong.
This letter was so plausible that even the _Times_ in an article on the 19th June, said:   Colonel Denison is a representative Canadian of the highest character  and proved loyalty, and no doubt his views prevail widely in British  North America.
At the same time the criticisms of his plan from a  strictly economic point of view which Sir Robert Giffen published in  our columns on Tuesday appear to us to be conclusive.
May I give my  answer?
He asks (1) how much under the scheme I proposed the Mother Country  would have to pay; (2) how much each of the principal Colonies; (3)  how the trade of each would be probably affected; (4) what exceptions  would be made as to Hong Kong and Singapore, which are distributing  centres?
These I shall answer together, dealing only with Canada,  as space will not admit my going fully into the whole question.
I  will take Sir Robert Giffen's figures, although he puts the foreign  imports of Canada and Newfoundland together at £24,000,000; while the  statistical abstract for colonial possessions gives the figures for  Canada alone at over £27,000,000 for 1900.
Taking Sir Robert Giffen's  figures, however, Canada would have to pay, on a basis of ten per  cent.
on foreign imports, nearly £2,400,000 per annum.
As the normal  amount Canada has been spending on defence in years past, has been  about £400,000 per annum, this would mean an additional payment by her  of £2,000,000 a year.
Sir Robert Giffen claims that the United Kingdom  would have to pay £41,000,000 per annum.
This is an extraordinary  statement.
The expenditure of the United Kingdom upon the Army and  Navy in ordinary years, not counting war expenses, far exceeds  £41,000,000.
So that the United Kingdom would not pay one farthing a  year more under the proposition than she always does expend.
This answers the first two points.
The United Kingdom would pay  nothing additional, Canada would expend £2,000,000 more than she has  been doing.
As to Canada's paying in proportion to her population, that would  be an unfair basis, because she is a young country with very little  accumulated wealth, and is developing and opening up enormous tracts  of territory at a great cost to the sparse population.
Great Britain  is a small country with a large population, and has been in process of  development for nearly 2,000 years, for I believe some Roman roads are  in use to-day.
The time will come when Canada will be able to do far  more.
As to how trade would be affected, I answer that the trade of the  United Kingdom would be greatly benefited.
The duty would tend to  protect for yourselves your home market, which you are rapidly losing.
It would give you advantages over the foreigner in the markets of  360,000,000 of people in the British possessions, in which at present  you are being attacked in the most pitiless and disastrous commercial  war.
It would turn emigration into your own dominions, instead of  aiding to build up foreign, and possibly hostile, countries.
In the  British Colonies the inhabitants purchase from the United Kingdom many  times as much per head as the inhabitants of foreign countries, and it  is the direct interest of the Mother Country to save her population  to build up her own Empire.
Your food supply also, which is in a  most dangerous and perilous condition--a condition which leaves our  Empire dependent upon the friendship of one or two nations for its  very existence--would be rapidly produced upon British soil among your  own people, and would make you once again an independent and powerful  nation.
At present you are existing upon sufferance.
Sir Robert Giffen speaks about the entrepot trade and the  difficulty of allowing goods to pass in bond.
We Canadians have so  many goods passing in bond through the United States, and the United  States have so many passing in bond through Canada, without the  slightest difficulty on either side, that we cannot see how there  could be any trouble about such an arrangement.
This system could  apply to Hong Kong and Singapore, and it should not require much  thought or ingenuity to arrange minor details of that kind, if the  broad principle was once agreed upon.
The question of taxing raw material for manufactures and its effect  upon exports to foreign countries could be easily arranged by the  simple expedient of granting a rebate of the duty on goods sent to  foreign countries.
I fancy this is an expedient well understood by  most civilised nations.
It is asked also what would be result of putting an extra 10 per  cent.
on exports from the United States into Canada.
It ought very  largely to increase the sale of British manufactured goods in Canada,  but I notice that Sir Robert Giffen, in counting the advantage to  the United Kingdom, leaves out the United States, and only counts  European competitors.
This is rather remarkable, when we remember that  the Canadian imports from the United States in 1900 were £22,570,763  and from all European countries under £4,000,000.
In this connection  it is interesting to note that British imports into Canada had been  declining for some years before 1897, but when the 33 1/3 per cent.
preference was given to the United Kingdom the imports from it into  Canada rose from £6,000,000 worth in 1897 to £9,000,000 in 1900.
Sir Robert Giffen claims that the Colonies would gain the full amount  of the 10 per cent.
tax on the foreigner in increased prices.
If so,  why should not the United Kingdom gain the 10 per cent.
on all she  sold in the Empire?
The rule should certainly work both ways; but, as  a matter of fact, a large portion of the duty would be borne by the  foreigner.
The greater part of the present tax on flour is now being  paid by the United States railways, through the reduction of their  freight rates in order to meet it.
Sir Robert Giffen repeats a second time, to impress it upon his  readers, that the proposed preferential arrangements would impose a  charge upon the people of the United Kingdom of £42,000,000, as if  the people would have to pay that amount more than they do now.
This  I emphatically deny.
It will only mean a rearrangement of taxation.
A  little more would go on grain and manufactured goods and other things,  but it could come off tea and tobacco or income tax, so that the  taxpayer would pay no more, and it makes little difference to him on  what he pays it, if he actually pays out the same amount for his needs  each year.
In Canada we feel that Great Britain is steadily losing her trade,  that her home markets are being invaded, that she is in great and  constant danger as to her food, that her mercantile marine is slipping  from her, her agriculture being ruined, and that anything that would  tend to keep the markets of the Empire for the Empire would be of  enormous advantage to her.
The British Empire League in Canada  suggested the scheme they have urged me to advocate in this country.
This scheme has received general support in Canada, but the League  will, I am sure, be pleased with any effective plan which will put  matters in a better position for the advantage of the Empire as a  whole.
_18th June._  This letter was not replied to.
Lally Bernard writing from London to the Toronto _Globe_ of the 8th July says:   There is a great deal of argument going on in a quiet way regarding  the controversy between Sir Robert Giffen and Colonel George Denison,  on the subject of an Imperial Zollverein, and the reply of Colonel  Denison to Sir Robert Giffen's letter in the _Times_ has aroused the  warmest admiration even from those who are diametrically opposed to  his theory.
Sir Wilfrid Laurier with Sir Wm.
Mulock, Mr.
Fielding, and Mr. Patterson, arrived in London a few days after this.
I had been surprised at Dr. Borden's attempt to weaken and destroy the effect of what little I had done to prepare public opinion, and thinking that Sir Wilfrid and the other Ministers must have sympathised with what he had done, I came to the conclusion that there was no use in me taking any further trouble in the matter.
I ceased any work, and although I was constantly meeting Sir Wilfrid and his colleagues I never once spoke to them upon the question.
I had been having several conversations with Mr. Chamberlain, and knew exactly what his position was, and he had asked me to press the Canadian delegates to take a certain course.
In view of Dr. Borden's action I had not attempted to do anything on the line Mr. Chamberlain suggested.
This was the condition of affairs when I had to leave for home, which was just before the meeting of the Conference.
I went down to the Hotel Cecil the morning before leaving, and called on Sir Wilfrid to say good-bye.
He seemed astonished when I told him why I had called, and asked when I was leaving; I told him the next day.
He urged me to stay over a week or two, but I said it was impossible as my passage was taken and all my arrangements made, and I said I knew he was going to a meeting and that I would not keep him.
To my great astonishment he said, "Sit down; I want to talk to you," and then he surprised me by asking my opinion as to what could be done at the Conference.
I was so astonished that I said, "You ask me what I would do in your place?"
He said, "Yes.
You have been here for over two months, you have been about the country addressing meetings, you have been discussing the question with the leading men, and you have studied the subject for years, and I want the benefit of your opinion.
Now what would you say as to moving the resolution you have been advocating?"
I thought for a moment and said, "No, Sir Wilfrid, I would not do that."
He asked me why.
I said, "Because it could not be carried.
I have discussed it with Mr. Chamberlain and he is not ready for it.
Sir Edmund Barton tells me that they are having a great fight over the tariff and could not take it up now.
Sir Gordon Sprigg says they are not in a position to do it on account of the war in Cape Colony, and Mr. Seddon is so full of another scheme connected with shipping, that while he would support it, it might not be as vigorous support as would be required."
Having the opening, however, I told him of my conversation with Mr. Chamberlain, and pressed upon him the advisability of taking up Mr. Chamberlain's idea, which was for Canada to give Great Britain further preferences on certain articles, in fact, if possible free entry of those articles in return for the preference of the one shilling a quarter on wheat.
I think this was already his view, but I pointed out all the advantages from a Canadian point of view of this plan, and expressing the hope that he would be able to see his way to it, I said good-bye and left him.
I saw my friend and colleague in my work, the Hon.
G. W. Ross, and told him of the conversation, and asked him to press the same view upon the Canadian Ministers, which he did.
On my arrival in Toronto the representatives of the Toronto newspapers came to interview me on my work.
Among other things, I said:   I am entirely satisfied that Sir Wilfrid Laurier and Mr.
Fielding  and Sir William Mulock are doing all in their power to obtain some  advantageous arrangement for Canada at this Conference.
They have  all been impressed with the importance of their mission and their  speeches have been along the best lines.
Fielding made an  admirable speech at the United Empire Trade League luncheon, in which  he expressed the unanimity of the Canadian people in favour of the  preference to England, stating that both parties were in favour of it,  and appealing to Sir Charles Tupper, who sat near him, to corroborate  this.
George W. Ross at the annual meeting of the British Empire  League, with the Duke of Devonshire as chairman, made a telling and  impressive speech, strongly advocating preferential tariffs within  the Empire.
But in the face of Sir Frederick Borden's efforts in the  opposite direction, these and the other splendid addresses of Sir  Wilfrid and his colleagues could not have the effect that they would  have produced had our representatives been of one mind in the matter.
I was very much astonished at Sir Frederick Borden's action in stating  that I represented nobody's views but my own, when he must have known  that I never intended to represent anybody's views except those of the  British Empire League, and that at all public meetings I invariably  read the resolutions that had been passed asking me to take a certain  course.
His endeavours to minimise the result of my work and to lull  the English mind into believing that everything was well, and that  nothing should be done, must have had an injurious effect, as I have  said, upon the efforts that Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Sir William Mulock,  and Mr.
Fielding were making upon behalf of Canada.
Col. Denison was asked by one of those present as to the reason for  Sir Frederick Borden's attitude, and he replied, "That I cannot tell  you.
I can only recall the remark of Lord Beaconsfield, made once in  reference to Lord John Russell.
He said, 'Against bad faith a man may  guard, but it is beyond all human sagacity to baffle the unconscious  machinations of stupidity.'"
Sir Michael Hicks-Beach resigned from the Cabinet while I was on my way home.
I always felt that the desire of Mr. Chamberlain to give a preference to the Colonies to the extent of the one shilling a quarter on wheat had something to do with the retirement of Sir Michael Hicks-Beach.
In 1906 I lunched with Mr. Chamberlain and he explained to me why he had been unable to carry out the preferential arrangement that he had outlined to me before Sir Wilfrid Laurier arrived in England in 1902.
The difficulty was that Sir Michael Hicks-Beach objected to it because he had imposed the duty avowedly as a means of raising revenue for war purposes, that he had defended it and justified it as a necessity on account of the war expenses, that the war was only just being concluded, and the outlay for months to come could not be diminished.
For that reason he was firmly opposed to reducing any portion of the duty for the time.
This prevented Sir Wilfrid Laurier's offers being accepted, and postponed action indefinitely, as the Conference concluded its session about the same time.
Sir Edmund Barton and Sir John Forrest went through Canada on their way home to Australia from the Conference, and they with their party dined at my house.
During the day I drove Sir Edmund and Lady Barton about Toronto.
I told Sir Edmund what I had been urging Sir Wilfrid to do at the Conference, and the remark he made was peculiar.
He said that the proceedings of the Conference were as yet confidential and he could not speak of them, but he might say that I should be well satisfied with my Premier.
I was confident then that Sir Wilfrid had taken that line which the official reports shortly afterwards corroborated.
The final result was, however, that our efforts had been unsuccessful, and our movement had received a serious set-back.
We were encouraged in October, 1902, by the action of the National Union of Conservative Associations held at Manchester on the 15th of that month, when Sir Howard Vincent obtained the adoption of a resolution in favour of Imperial preferential trade.
The New York _Tribune_, commenting on this, said: "This news is a great triumph for the Hon.
Joseph Chamberlain's views, and it also no doubt goes to show that Colonel Denison's recent imperialistic campaign in the Motherland was not without decided educative effect."
On the 20th October, 1902, the National Club of Toronto gave a complimentary banquet to me in recognition of the work I had done in England that summer for the Empire.
Mr. J. F. Ellis, President of the Club, occupied the chair; the Hon.
J. Israel Tarte and the Hon.
George W. Ross were present.
There was a large and influential gathering.
I was very much gratified at Mr. Tarte's presence.
Although once associating with the Continental Union League, he had for years been a loyal and active member of our British Empire League.
He was at the time a Cabinet Minister, and came from Ottawa to Toronto solely to attend the dinner, and it was at such a crisis in his career that he wrote out his resignation from the Government on the train while coming up.
His speech is worth reproducing:   Mr. President and Gentlemen of the National Club,--I think it is  fit, I think it is proper, that French Canada should be represented  at a gathering like this.
I am not here this evening as a member of  the Dominion Cabinet.
Am I a member of the Dominion Cabinet?
That is  the question.
That is the question I very diplomatically declined to  answer when I was leaving Ottawa to come here.
Being a Minister is  not the most care-free life in the world.
It is an occupation that is  exposed to accidents of all kinds.
A Minister is exposed to tremendous  hazards--to the fire of the newspapers, to the bad temper of members  of Parliament, to the assaults of opponents, and occasionally to the  tender mercies of your best personal friends.
I am present to-night as a British subject of Canadian origin--of  French-Canadian origin--proud of British institutions, and feeling in  that pride that he is speaking the sentiments of his countrymen in  the Province of Quebec.
I have been connected with the British Empire  League since 1888.
I am not prepared to say that I have approved all  the speeches made by all members of the League, or that I have always  agreed with the speeches that members of the League make here.
I have  in mind the fact, however, that decent speeches of other people have  not always been properly appreciated.
I was agreed from the start  and am agreed now with the primary object of the League, which is  to promote British interests abroad and at home, to bring about a  better knowledge of our needs and a better understanding between all  portions of the Empire.
We belong to a great Empire; great through its  power, great through its wealth, but especially great through its free  institutions.
I have now been thirty years in public life, as a newspaper man, as  a member of the Legislature of my native province, and as a Cabinet  Minister.
After having travelled pretty extensively, observing as  I went, after having visited several exhibitions of the world, I  have come to the conclusion that British institutions are the best  adapted to bring about the greatness of this country, as they make for  happiness, safety, prosperity, progress, and permanency.
Since I have been in office as Minister of Public Works, and that  is six years and three months, I have endeavoured to the best of my  ability to build up British and Canadian commercial independence on  this continent.
I have done my best to improve and develop trade  between the Empire through Canadian soil, through Canadian channels,  in Canadian bottoms, and through Canadian railways.
Let us not be satisfied, continued Mr. Tarte.
Let us make up our minds  to make ourselves at home from a national as well as a commercial  standpoint.
Col. Denison, who is allowed to speak of things of which other  people fear the consequence, has spoken of the tariff.
Col. Denison  has spoken of Chamberlain, and has quoted Chamberlain's words on  the tariff.
Chamberlain is not Minister of Finance--he is Colonial  Secretary.
He has spoken of the tariff, mind you.
I think he should be  dismissed.
He has violated the Constitution of England, and doesn't  know what he has done.
He has spoken on the tariff, and he has spoken  for Protection.
He is a dangerous man.
He has said foreign nations had  formed combinations, and were maintaining hostile tariffs and that the  English nation was suffering by reason of this.
He will be punished.
This was a satirical allusion to the fact that he was being forced out of the Cabinet, because, as Minister of Public Works, he had discussed in public meetings the question of tariff policy.
He was put out of the Cabinet the next day.
I therefore watched public opinion very carefully and with considerable anxiety, and I noticed two or three uncomfortable indications.
In the first place a restlessness manifested itself among the manufacturing classes in Canada, particularly in the woollen trade, against the British preference which pressed upon them, while Canada received no corresponding advantage, and a discussion began as to whether the British preference should not be cut off.
The next thing which alarmed me was that during the following winter a movement arose in the United States to secure the establishment of a reciprocity treaty with Canada.
Suggestions were made to renew the sittings of the High Joint Commission which had adjourned in 1898 without anything being done.
This was evaded by our Government, but a strong agitation was commenced in the Eastern States, and supported in Chicago, to educate the people of the United States in favour of tariff arrangements with Canada.
The more far-seeing men in the United States were uneasy about the movement for mutual preferential tariffs in the British Empire.
They saw at once that if successful it would consolidate and strengthen British power and wealth and would be a severe blow to the prosperity of the United States, which for fifty years had been fattening upon the free British markets, while for thirty years their own had been to a great extent closed to the foreigner and preserved for their own enrichment.
I felt that the failure of the Conference would give power to our enemies in the United States and aid them to enmesh us in the trade entanglements which would preclude the possibility of our succeeding in carrying our policy into effect.
Every week I became more and more alarmed.
It will be remembered that there was then no Tariff Reform movement in England.
That Lord Salisbury was dying, that Mr. Chamberlain had not yet openly committed himself, and that nothing was being done, while our opponents were actively at work both in the States and in Canada.
The small faction in Canada who were disloyal were once more taking heart while the loyal element were discouraged.
Still further to cause anxiety the Imperial Federation Defence Committee took this opportunity, through Mr. Arthur Loring, to make an imperious demand upon the Colonies to hand over at once large cash contributions in support of the Navy, or practically to cut us adrift.
Had the desire been to smash up the Empire, the attack could not have been better timed than when everything was going against the Imperial view.
Secretary of the Imperial  Federation (Defence) Committee, and your leading article upon the  question of colonial contributions to the Imperial Navy, I desire to  send a reply from the Canadian point of view.
Mr. Loring's proposition is practically that the Mother Country  should repudiate any further responsibility for the defence of the  Empire, unless the Colonies pay over cash contributions for the Navy  in the way and under the terms that will suit the Imperial Federation  (Defence) Committee.
The British Empire League in Canada and the  majority of the Canadians are as anxious for a secure Imperial Defence  as is Mr. Loring, but the spirit of dictation which runs through the  publications of his committee has always been a great difficulty in  our way, by arousing resentment in our people, who might do willingly  what they would object to be driven into.
Because we hesitate to pay  cash contributions we are attacked as if we had made no sacrifices for  the Empire.
Mr. Loring seems to forget our preference to all British  goods, which has caused Germany to cut off the bulk of our exports  to that country, to forget that we imposed a duty on sugar in order  by preference to help the West Indies in the Imperial interest, that  we helped to construct the Pacific cable for the same reason, or  that numbers of our young men fought and died for the cause in South  Africa.
We have proved in many ways our willingness to make sacrifices  for the Empire, and yet, because we will not do just exactly what Mr.  Loring's committee suggest, they wish to cut us adrift.
This is a very impolitic and dangerous suggestion.
It is so important  that we should understand each other, and that you in England should  know how we look at this question, that I hope you will allow me to  say a few words upon this subject.
The British Empire League in Canada requested me as their president to  go to Great Britain last April to advocate a duty of 5 to 10 per cent.
all round the Empire on all foreign goods in order to provide a fund  for Imperial Defence.
This proposition was approved of at a number of  meetings held in various parts of Canada, and by political leaders of  all shades of politics and I am certain it would have been confirmed  by a large majority in our Parliament had Great Britain and the other  Colonies agreed to it.
I addressed a number of meetings in England and Scotland, and  discussed the question with many of the political leaders in London.
I soon discovered while the audiences were receptive, and many  approved of the proposition, that nevertheless it was new, contrary  to their settled prejudices, and that it would take time and popular  education on the subject before such an arrangement could be carried  in the House of Commons.
When Sir Wilfrid Laurier came over just  before the Conference, knowing that I had been discussing the subject  for two months, he asked me if I thought the proposition I had been  advocating could be proposed at the Conference with any prospect of  success.
I replied that I did not think it could, that Great Britain  was not ready for it, that Australia at the time was engaged in such a  struggle over her revenue tariff that she could not act, and that if  I was in his place I should not attempt it.
He did, however, make a  number of suggestions at the Conference which, if accepted by the home  Government, would have gone a long way to place the Empire on a safer  footing.
The Mother Country would not agree to relieve Canada from the  corn duty, but was quite willing to accept and ask for contributions  for defence.
This Sir Wilfrid refused; and a large portion of our  people approve of that course, not because they do not feel that they  ought to contribute, not because they are not able to contribute, but  because they do not feel disposed to spend their money in what they  would consider a senseless and useless way.
We feel that to save our Empire, to consolidate it, to make it strong  and secure, there are several points that must be considered and that,  as all these points are essential, to spend money on some and leave  out others that are vital would be a useless and dangerous waste.
If our Empire is to live, she must maintain her trade and commerce,  she must keep up her manufactures, she must retain and preserve her  resources both in capital and population for her own possessions, she  must have bonds of interest as well as of sentiment, and she must have  a system of defence that shall be complete at all points.
An army or  a navy might be perfect in equipment, in training, in weapons, in  organisation, in skilled officers, &c., and yet if powder and cordite  were left out all would be useless waste.
If food were left out it  would be worst of all, and yet Mr. Loring asks us to contribute  large sums to maintain a navy, and to have that navy directed and  governed by a department in which we would have little or no voice--a  department under the control of an electorate who in the first war  with certain Powers (one of which we at least know is not friendly)  would be starving almost immediately, and would very soon insist on  surrendering the fleet to which we had contributed in order to get  food to feed their starving children.
They might even be willing to  surrender possessions as well.
While you in England maintain this  position, that you will not include food in your scheme of defence,  do you wonder that we in Canada should endeavour to perfect our own  defence in order to secure our own freedom and independence as a  people, if the general smash comes, which we dread as the possible  result of your obstinate persistence in a policy, which leaves you at  the mercy of one or two foreign nations.
I wish to draw attention to the following figures, which seem to show  that there is weakness and danger in your commercial affairs as well:                              1900.
United Kingdom imports (foreign)          £413,544,528   United Kingdom exports (foreign)           252,349,700                                             ------------   Balance of trade against United Kingdom   £161,194,828                                1901.
United Kingdom imports (foreign)         £416,416,492   United Kingdom exports (foreign)          234,745,904                                            ------------   Balance of trade against United Kingdom  £181,670,588   We see the result of this great import of foreign goods in the  distress in England to-day.
The cable reports tell us of unemployed  farm labourers flocking into the towns, of unemployed townsmen  parading the streets with organised methods of begging, of charity  organisations taxed to their utmost limit to relieve want.
We see the  Mother Country ruining herself and enriching foreign nations by a  blind adherence to a fetish, and we begin to wonder how long it can  last.
Adopt the policy of a duty upon all foreign goods, bind your Empire  together by bonds of interest, turn your emigration and capital into  your own possessions, produce ten or twelve million quarters more of  wheat in your own islands, no matter what the cost may be, and then  ask us to put in our contributions towards the common defence, for  then an effective defence might be made.
Just before the Conference I had a conversation with you and Lord  Onslow in reference to Canada's action.
You considered that it would  be useless at the time to attempt to carry the proposition that I  had been advocating in Great Britain, of a 5 to 10 per cent.
duty  around the Empire for a defence fund.
You told me what line you  thought the most likely to succeed, and advised me that Canada should  try to meet your views by further concessions to Great Britain in  return for advantages for us in your markets.
I urged this upon Sir  Wilfrid Laurier, and I understand that he was willing to meet you, if  possible, on the lines indicated.
Unfortunately, nothing was done.
I  fancy your colleagues got frightened, for I know that you personally  had a clear insight into the matter, and fully appreciated the  importance of something being done.
Now I wish to tell you how matters stand out here.
Our people are very  much discouraged.
Many of our strongest Imperialists in the past are  beginning to advocate the repeal of our preference to Great Britain.
The manufacturers who were in favour of the preference, provided we  had a prospect of getting a reciprocal advantage in your markets,  are, many of them for their personal ends, now desirous of stopping  it.
All the disaffected (there are not very many of them) are using  the failure of the Conference to attack and ridicule the Imperial  cause.
This is all very serious.
The gravest danger of all, however,  is that the United States will never give our Empire another chance to  consolidate itself if they can prevent it.
They are already agitating  for the reassembling of the High Joint Commission to consider, among  other things, reciprocal tariffs.
Only the other day a member of the  Massachusetts House of Assembly declared in that house that he had  assurances from Washington that the passage of a resolution in favour  of reciprocity with Canada would be welcomed by the administration.
We  see the danger of this, and our Government have made excuses to delay  the meeting of the Commission until October.
Now if nothing is done  in the meantime towards combining the Empire--if nothing is done to  make such a start towards it as would give our people encouragement,  what will happen?
The United States will give us the offer of free  reciprocity in natural products.
What would our people be likely to  do in that case?
All along the frontier our farmers would find it very  convenient to sell their barley, oats, hay, butter, poultry, eggs,  &c., to the cities on the border.
In the North West it would appeal  to our western farmers, who would be glad to get their wheat in free  to the mills of Minneapolis and St. Paul.
Such a proposition might  therefore carry in our Parliament, and would probably bind us for ten  or fifteen years.
This would be a dead block against any combination  of the Empire for preferential trade, for then you could not give us  a preference, as we would be debarred from putting a duty on United  States articles coming across our border, which would be necessary if  an Imperial scheme were carried out.
A proposition for reciprocity with the United States was made in 1887.
At the dinner given to you in Toronto that year I fired my first  shot against Commercial Union, and ever since I have been probably  the leader in the movement against it.
My main weapon, my strongest  weapon, was an Imperial discriminating tariff around the Empire.
We  succeeded in getting our people and Parliament and Government to  take the idea up and to do our side of it, and we have given the  discriminating tariff in your favour.
We hoped that you would meet us,  but nothing has been done, and our people feel somewhat hurt at the  result.
Where will we Imperialists be this autumn when the High Joint  Commission meets?
The people of the United States will be almost sure  to play the game to keep back our Empire, and we will be here with our  guns spiked, with all our weapons gone, and in a helpless condition.
I feel all this very deeply and think that I should lay the whole  matter before you.
I do not wish to see the Empire "fall to pieces  by disruption or by tolerated secession."
I do not wish to see "the  disasters which will infallibly come upon us."
I wish to see our  Empire "a great Empire" and not see Great Britain "a little State,"  and I do urge upon you as earnestly as I can to get something done  this Session that will give us a preference, no matter how small, in  order that our hands may be tied before the High Joint Commission  meets, so that we may escape the dangers of a reciprocity treaty, for  if we are tied up with one for ten years, our Empire may have broken  up before our hands are free again.
If something was done on the preference, I believe we could carry  large expenditures for Imperial Defence in our Parliament.
I enclose a  letter to the _Times_ which appeared while you were on the sea, which  I believe pretty fairly expressed the views of most of our people.
I wrote to him again on the 18th April, and on the 10th May received an answer which was much more encouraging.
I was not surprised when, on the 15th May, Mr. Chamberlain made his great speech at Birmingham, which resulted soon afterwards in his resignation from the Government, and the organisation of the Tariff Reform movement, which he has since advocated with such enthusiasm, energy, and ability.
The result of this speech was like the sun coming out from behind a cloud.
Instantly the whole prospect brightened, every Canadian was inspirited, and confidence was restored.
Such an extraordinary change has seldom been seen.
The Toronto correspondent of the _Morning Post_, 17th May, 1903, said:   Canada has seldom before shown such unanimity over a proposed Imperial  policy, as that which greets the project of Mr. Chamberlain for the  granting of trade concessions to the British Colonies in the markets  of Great Britain.
It is this hope in the ultimate triumph of Mr. Chamberlain's policy which has caused the Canadian people to wait patiently for that result.
The extraordinary defeat of the Unionist party in the elections of 1906 has not destroyed this confidence, and the Empire has yet a chance to save herself.
The 6th annual meeting of the British Empire League took place on 19th May, 1903, in the Railway Committee Room, House of Commons, Ottawa.
A very unpleasant event occurred about this time in the Alaskan Award.
I had looked into the matter very closely while Sir Wilfrid Laurier was in Washington engaged in the negotiations over the dispute, and I felt confident that we had a very weak case for our contentions, in fact I thought we had none at all.
I saw Chief Justice Armour, who was to be one of the Canadian Commissioners, just before he left for England.
He was a friend of mine, and one of the ablest judges who ever sat in the Canadian Courts, and I told him what I thought.
He evidently felt much the same.
I said to him that I wished to make a remark that might be stowed away in the back of his head in case of any necessity for considering it.
It was that when he had done his very best for Canada, and had done all that he could, if he found that Lord Alverstone would not hold out with him, not to have a split but if the case was hopeless to join with Lord Alverstone and make the decision unanimous.
I said if Lord Alverstone went against us the game was up, there was no further appeal, no remedy, and there was no use fighting against the inevitable, and it would be in more conformity with the dignity of Canada, and good feeling in the Empire, to have an award settled judicially, and by all the judges.
Mr. Aylesworth had been the advocate all his life.
At that time he had absolutely no knowledge of political affairs.
The award was better than I expected and gave us two islands, which the United States had held for years, and on one of which a United States Post Office had been long established.
Mr. Aylesworth forgetting there was no appeal, and that the matter was final, prevailed on Lt.-Governor Jetté who was with him to make a most violent protest, and a direct attack upon Lord Alverstone.
Owing to this, the award created a good deal of resentment in Canada.
The people were very much aroused, and believed they had been betrayed.
By the time Mr. Aylesworth arrived in Toronto he had time to think the matter over.
The Canadian Club had organised a great banquet in his honour, and I am of opinion that when he arrived at home, he was astonished at the storm he had aroused.
He at once allayed the excited feelings of his audience by a most loyal, patriotic, and statesmanlike speech, and quieted the feeling to a great extent, although it is still a very sore question in Canada, and Lord Alverstone is placed on the same shelf with Mr. Oswald of the treaty of 1783, and Lord Ashburton who gave away a great part of the State of Maine; but had I been in Lord Alverstone's place, and I am an out and out Canadian, with no sympathy whatever with the United States, I should have done as he did.
In the spring of 1903 a controversy arose between Mr. Joseph Chamberlain and the present Lord Salisbury in which I was able to intervene on Mr. Chamberlain's side with some effect.
Mr. Chamberlain had said in a public letter that the late Lord Salisbury had favoured retaliation and closer commercial union with the colonies.
The present Lord Salisbury wrote to _The Times_ saying that his father profoundly dissented from Mr. Chamberlain's fiscal policy.
Several letters followed from Mr. Chamberlain and Sir Michael Hicks-Beach.
As I am in a position to throw some light  upon the late Premier's opinions on these questions, I would ask your  permission to say a few words.
I was for some years president of the Imperial Federation League  in Canada, and since it was merged in the British Empire League I  have held the same position in that body.
In 1890 I was appointed  specially to represent the Canadian League in England for the  purpose of advocating the denunciation of the German and Belgian  treaties, and of urging the establishment of a system of preferential  tariffs between Canada and the Mother Country.
In two interviews  with Lord Salisbury, I urged both points upon him as strongly as  possible, and pointed out to him that our League had taken up the  policy of preferential tariffs in order to counteract the movement  for commercial union or unrestricted reciprocity between the United  States and Canada, which at that time was a very dangerous agitation.
After hearing my arguments, Lord Salisbury said that he felt that the  real way to consolidate the Empire would be by a Zollverein and a  Kriegsverein.
This was substantially our policy, and I begged of him  to say something on that line publicly, as it would be a great help  to us in the struggle we were having on behalf of Imperial Unity.
He  did not say whether he would do so or not; but a few months later at  the Lord Mayor's banquet at the Guildhall in November, 1890, he made  a speech which attracted considerable attention, and which gave us in  Canada great encouragement.
He spoke of the hostile tariffs and said:  "Therefore it is that we are anxious above all things to conserve,  to unify, to strengthen the Empire of the Queen because it is to  the trade that is carried on within the Empire of the Queen that we  look for the vital force of the commerce of this country.
The  conflict which we have to fight is a conflict of tariffs."
At Hastings on May 18th, 1892, he made another speech still more  pronounced the terms of which are well known.
We carried on a correspondence for many years, and I saw him on  several occasions when I visited England.
We discussed the policy of  preferential tariffs and the denunciation of the German and Belgian  treaties, which were denounced by his Government in August, 1897.
His  letters to me show how strongly he was in sympathy with us; but he was  a statesman of great caution and evidently would not commit himself to  practical action in regard to either preference or fair trade, as long  as he believed that the prejudice against any taxation on articles of  the first necessity was too strong to be overcome.
The following extracts are taken from letters received by me from Lord  Salisbury, and they give a clear idea of what his opinions were.
In  the early days of the movement I was probably the only one who was  pressing on Lord Salisbury the urgent need of some action being taken,  and he may not have had occasion to express his views upon the subject  to many others.
In a letter dated March 21st, 1891, in reply to one from me telling  him of the danger of reciprocity or commercial union with the United  States, he wrote:   "I agree with you that the situation is full of danger, and that the  prospect before us is not inviting.
The difficulties with which we  shall have to struggle will tax all the wisdom and all the energy of  both English and Canadian statesmen during the next five or ten years.
I should be very glad if I saw any immediate hope of our being able  to assist you by a modification of our tariff arrangements.
The main  difficulty I think, lies in the great aversion felt by our people here  to the imposition of any duties on articles of the first necessity.
It  is very difficult to bring home to the constituency the feeling that  the maintenance of our Empire in its integrity may depend upon fiscal  legislation.
It is not that they do not value the tie which unites us  to the colonies; on the contrary, it is valued more and more in this  country, but they do not give much thought to political questions and  they are led away by the more unreasoning and uncompromising advocates  of free trade.
There is a movement of opinion in this country, and I  only hope it may be rapid enough to meet the necessities of our time."
In another letter, dated November 22nd, 1892, he wrote:   "I wish there were more prospect of some fiscal arrangements which  would meet the respective exigencies of England and Canada, but that  appears still to be in the far distance."
"In another letter written nine years later, dated March 1st, 1901, a little over a year before his final retirement from office, referring to a report of the speeches at the annual meeting of our League in Canada, which I had sent to him, he wrote:   "It is very interesting to read Mr. Ross's address about the error  into which free trade may run, for I am old enough to remember the  rise of free trade, and the contempt with which the apprehensions of  the protectionists of that day were received.
But a generation must  pass before the fallacies then proclaimed will be unlearnt.
There are  too many people whose minds were formed under their influence, and  until those men have died out no change of policy can be expected."
"These extracts show very clearly Lord Salisbury's views, and prove that personally he would have favoured preferential tariffs in order to save and preserve a great Empire."
This was much commented on in the British Press.
_The Times_ said:   The extraordinarily interesting letter which we publish from Colonel  Denison, the president of the British Empire League in Canada, shows  how deeply sensible was the late Lord Salisbury of the obstacles which  prejudice and tradition offer to the adoption of a genuine policy  of tariff reform, and how conscious he was of the difficulties to a  practical statesman of overcoming them.
The London _Globe_ said:   Few more remarkable contributions have been made recently to the  controversy over fiscal reform than the letters of the late Marquis of  Salisbury, which Colonel Denison, of Toronto, has communicated to _The  Times_.
The _Outlook_ said:   The invaluable letter in _The Times_ from Colonel G. T. Denison, of  Toronto, has disposed once for all of Lord Hugh Cecil's theory that  the system of free imports ought to be regarded as a Conservative  institution.
Passages cited by Colonel Denison from unpublished  letters and forgotten speeches prove that the late Lord Salisbury's  agreement with the principles of Mr. Chamberlain's policy was complete.
Lord Hugh Cecil had the following letter in _The Times_ of the 20th May, 1905.
The extracts from the  letters published by Colonel Denison do not seem to me to have any  bearing on Lord Salisbury's attitude towards any question that is now  before the public.
I myself think that it is undesirable to quote the opinions of the  dead, however eminent, in reference to a living controversy.
But  since the attempt continues to be made by tariff reformers to claim  Lord Salisbury's authority in support of their views, it is right to  say that I have no more doubt than have any of my brothers that Lord  Salisbury profoundly dissented from Mr. Chamberlain's proposals so far  as they were developed during his lifetime.
Not only did he repeatedly  express that dissent to us, and to others who had been in official  relations with him, but he caused a letter to be written in that sense  to one of my brothers.
In conclusion, may I point out that it would have been more courteous  in Colonel Denison, if he had at least consulted Lord Salisbury's  personal representatives before publishing extracts from Lord  Salisbury's private correspondence?
As  his letter contains a reflection on my action in publishing extracts  from the late Lord Salisbury's letters to me, I hope you will allow me  to make an explanation.
Mr. Chamberlain had claimed that the late Lord Salisbury had approved  of his policy of preferential tariffs, while the present Lord  Salisbury held that his father "had profoundly dissented from Mr.  Chamberlain's fiscal policy."
As Lord Salisbury and his brothers had published their father's  private opinions, which may have referred more to the time and method  and details of Mr. Chamberlain's action than to the general principle  of preferential tariffs, I had no reason to think that there could be  any objection to publishing the late Premier's own written words on  the subject.
The letters from which I quoted, although not intended  for publication at the time, contained his views on a great public  question, and did not relate to any person, or any private matter, and  as he was not here to speak for himself, I felt that it was desirable  to publish the extracts in order to show clearly what his views were.
Lord Robert Cecil says that it would have been more courteous in me to  have consulted with his father's representatives before publishing,  but in view of their own action in publishing his oral, private  opinions, it would seem discourteous to assume that they could, under  the circumstances, desire to suppress positive evidence on a matter of  grave public importance to our Empire.
This closed the episode.
I arrived in London on the 27th June, and the next evening, at the Royal Colonial Institute Conversazione, I met Mr. and Mrs. Chamberlain, and it was arranged that my wife and I were to lunch with them a few days later.
Mr. Chamberlain had wished that we should be alone.
After lunch the ladies went upstairs, and Mr. Chamberlain had a quiet talk with me for about an hour.
He gave me the whole history of the difficulties he had encountered and explained how it was that he was not able to carry out the arrangement we had discussed in 1902, just before the conference.
He told me that Sir Michael Hicks-Beach objected to throwing off the one shilling a quarter on wheat in favour of the colonies, because he had put it on only a short time before as a necessary war tax to raise funds for the South African War, that the expenses were still going on, and that it would be inconsistent in him to agree to it at the time.
Shortly after Sir Michael Hicks-Beach resigned from the Cabinet and Mr. C. T. Ritchie (afterwards Lord Ritchie) was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer.
In the autumn it was considered advisable, so Mr. Chamberlain told me, that he should pay a visit to South Africa, which would take him away for some months, and he went on to say: "On my return from South Africa we called at Madeira, and I found there a cablegram from Austen saying the corn tax was to be taken off.
When I arrived in London the Budget was coming up very soon.
I could not do anything for many reasons.
I did not wish to precipitate a crisis, and I had to wait."
He was evidently annoyed at the matter, and explained it to me, because he had held out hopes to me that if Sir Wilfrid Laurier would meet him with further preferences, he would give us the preference in wheat.
This he had been unable to do.
I asked him if he could explain why Ritchie acted as he did.
He did not seem to know.
I suggested that I thought either Mr. Choate, the United States Ambassador, or some other United States emissary, had frightened him and he had taken off the tax to head off any movement for imperial trade consolidation.
Mr. Chamberlain asked me why I thought so, and I drew his attention to the fact that shortly after the corn tax was taken off Mr. Ritchie went down to Croydon to address his constituents, and in justifying his action used the argument--apparently to his mind the strongest--that a preferential corn tax against the United States would be likely to arouse the hostility of that country and be a dangerous course to pursue.
The audience seemed at once to be struck with the cowardice of the argument, and there were loud cries of dissent, and then they rose and sang "Rule Britannia."
Mr. Ritchie did not contest Croydon in the next election, but was moved to the House of Lords shortly before his death.
Mr. Chamberlain apparently had not thought of that influence.
Mr. Chamberlain was then looking in perfect health, and left the next day for Birmingham, where great demonstrations were made over his 70th birthday.
He told me he was anxious to have a rest, as the burden of leading a great movement was very heavy.
I urged him strongly to take a holiday, and I had pressed the same idea upon Mrs. Chamberlain as I sat next to her at lunch.
He took ill, however, before a week had passed.
The strain at Birmingham was very heavy.
The meeting of the Congress of Chambers of Commerce of the Empire took place on the 10th, 11th and 13th July.
We had but little hope of doing anything to help the preferential trade policy, for the General Elections had gone so overwhelmingly against us that it seemed impossible that in England our Canadian delegation could carry the resolution they had agreed upon in favour of Mr. Chamberlain's policy.
We expected to be badly defeated, but decided to make a bold fight.
After the discussion had gone on for some time, Sir Wm.
Holland and Lord Avebury, who led the free trade ranks, approached Mr. Drummond, who had moved the Canadian resolution, and suggested that if we would compromise by the insertion of a few words which would have destroyed the whole effect of what we were fighting for, the resolution might be carried unanimously.
I said at once, "I would not compromise to the extent of one word.
Let us fight it out to the very end, let us take a vote.
We will likely be beaten, but let us take our beating like men.
We will find out our strength and our weakness, we will find out who are our friends and who are our enemies, and know exactly where we stand."
Mr. Cockshutt said immediately, "I entirely agree with Denison."
Drummond said, "That is exactly my view.
I shall consult with no others but will tell them we will fight it to the end."
I spoke that afternoon as follows as reported in the Toronto _News_, 23rd August, 1906:   There were a few remarks, said Col. Denison, which had fallen from  previous speakers, to which he desired to call attention.
In the  first place, his friend Mr. Cockshutt, said that Canada had given  England the benefit of five million dollars annually in the reduction  of duties, in order to help the English manufacturer to sell English  manufactured goods in Canada, and stated that that was a contribution  in an indirect way towards helping the defence of the Empire.
Mr.  Cockshutt, however, left out one important point.
If Canada had put  that tax on, collected the money, and handed over the five million  dollars to England in hard cash, what would have been the result?
The  greater portion of the trade would have gone to Germany, would have  given work to German workmen, would have helped to build German ships,  and it would have taken more than the five million dollars annually  to counterbalance the loss thereby caused to this country.
He felt  that every day the British people were allowing the greatest national  trade asset that any nation ever possessed, the markets of Great  Britain, to be exposed to the free attack of every rival manufacturing  nation in the world without any protection, without any possibility  of preserving those great national assets for the use of their own  people, and in his opinion such a policy was exceedingly foolish.
He had heard a gentleman from Manchester say that it was all very well  for Canada, and that Canada wanted it.
He was one of the very earliest  of Canadians who advocated preferential tariffs.
In 1887 he began with  a number of other men who were working with him, to educate the people  of Canada on the subject.
When they first began they were laughed at;  they were told it was a fad, and it was contrary to the principles of  free trade.
When he came to England years ago he could find hardly a  single man anywhere who would say anything against free trade.
He was  perfectly satisfied that for years English people would have listened  much more patiently to attacks upon the Christian religion than they  would have to attacks upon free trade.
Why did they advocate the system of preferential tariffs in Canada?
Because the country was founded by the old United Empire Loyalists,  who stood loyal to this country in 1776, who abandoned all their  worldly possessions, who left the graves of their dead, and came away  from the homes where they were born into the wilderness of Canada, and  who wanted to carry their own flag with them.
They wanted to be in a  country where they were in connection with the Motherland, and it was  the dream of those loyalists to have a united Empire.
Canadians were  not advocating preferential tariffs for the benefit of Canada.
He said, further, that if England would not give Canada a preference,  although Canada had already given England one, at least it was  advisable that England should have some tariff reform which would  prevent the wealth which belonged to this great Empire being  dissipated among its enemies.
That was the reason they were advocating  the resolution.
It was said that they desired to tax the poor man's  food.
He said it was of the utmost importance to have food grown in  their own country.
England in the past had had no reserves of food.
Fortunately they were now in such a position that, if they kept the  command of the sea, Canada would be able to grow enough in a year or  two for the needs of the United Kingdom.
Seven years ago England was  in such a position that, if a combination of two nations had put an  embargo on food, she would have been brought to her knees at once.
Australia and Canada were now growing more wheat, but everything  depended upon the navy; and if England allowed her trade and her  markets, and the profits which could be made out of the markets, to be  used by foreign and rival Powers to build navies, they were not only  helping those foreign nations to build navies at their own cost, but  at the same time the people of this country had to be taxed to build  ships to counterbalance what their enemies were doing.
Canadians felt that they were part of the Empire.
They had helped as  much as their fathers did; but after all, they had only added to the  strength of the Empire, because their fathers went abroad to other  nations, carrying the flag and spreading British principles and ideas  into other countries.
He therefore contended that Canadians had a  great right to urge upon the people of England to do all they could to  preserve the Empire, as Canadians were doing in their humble way.
As had been already said, Canada was giving preferences.
For instance,  she was giving a preference to the West Indies, so that nearly every  dollar that was paid for sugar in Canada went to the West Indies.
A  few years ago it all came from Germany, and the profits that were made  out of Canadian markets went to Germany, and, although they were not  comparable with the profits made out of the English markets, such as  they were they helped Germany.
The trade gave her people employment;  gave her navy money, and enabled her still further to build rival  battleships.
Was that wise?
Canada asked England to remedy  that; but Canada did not want it if England did not, because England  wanted it five, ten, fifteen, or thirty times more than Canada did.
Free trade at one time existed in Canada.
When he was a very young  man he was a free trader, but he was now older and wiser.
What was  the condition of the country then?
It was a country with the greatest  natural resources in the world, with the most magnificent agricultural  prospects, with mineral and every other resource, such as he believed  had not been paralleled anywhere else on the globe.
Yet, for twenty  years, when they had only a revenue tariff, what happened?
The Yankees  in 1871 put on a large protective duty, and commenced to build up  their manufactures.
The result to Canada was that in a few years, in  1875, 1876, and 1877, the Americans not only made for themselves but  introduced their goods into Canadian markets.
The result was that  Canadian manufactories were closed up, the streets of the cities were  filled with unemployed, and during that early period of their history  nearly one million Canadians left the country.
It was so well known  that it was called "the exodus."
People used to wonder what was the  matter, and enquired whether there was a plague in the country.
They  used to enquire how it was that Canadians could not succeed, and how  it was there were so many people starving in the streets.
An agitation was started for a national policy--a protective  agitation.
Canadians decided that they must protect their own  manufactures, and they had done so since 1878, with the result that  there were now no starving people in the streets, no want in the  country, no submerged tenth, and no thirteen million people on the  verge of starvation.
The exodus had ceased from Canada to the States,  and Canadians were now coming back in their tens and twenties of  thousands.
Canada was now prosperous.
A great deal had been done in  the last twenty years.
For instance, Canada had to come to England  to get an English company to build the Grand Trunk Railway.
They  did not do it wonderfully well, but still they did it, and it was  now a fine railroad.
But what had Canadians done?
They had built  the Canadian Pacific Railway to the other side; two gentlemen in  Toronto were building another trans-continental railroad right across  the continent, and the Government were assisting a third project,  the Grand Trunk Pacific.
The Canadian Pacific Railroad, a Canadian  institution, managed in Canada, had its vessels on the western coast  at Vancouver, carrying goods and passengers through to Japan, to the  Far East, and Australia and New Zealand.
All that had been done since  Canada took up the policy which enabled it to prevent the enemy from  bleeding it to death.
He hoped he had made the point clear.
Surely England would desire to  follow the example of Canada in that respect.
"The exodus" was now  taking place.
The Right Hon.
John Morley, in reply to a speech that  he (Col. Denison) made, referred to the wonderful prosperity of Great  Britain, which depended on free trade.
Now he would tell the delegates  the other side.
The Right Hon.
James Bryce went to Aberdeen just at  the time the Government put the tax of a shilling a quarter on wheat.
The Right Hon.
James Bryce, who was a very able and clever man, made  a powerful and eloquent speech, but he had not lived long enough in  Canada.
He said that the tax of a shilling a quarter on wheat would  make a difference of 7½_d._ per annum to each person in the United  Kingdom, and that it would be a great burden upon the ordinary working  man of the country: but when they thought of the lowest class of the  people, about 30 per cent.
of the population, or 13 millions, as Sir  Henry Campbell-Bannerman had said, who were living upon the very verge  of want, then he said it would mean reduced subsistence, frequent  hunger, weakness of body, and susceptibility to disease.
Was that  not an awful fact for a prosperous country?
Was it not an awful fact  to think that 8_d_ in a whole year would mean reduced subsistence,  frequent hunger, weakness of body and susceptibility to disease to  13 million of English people?
That was the condition of England.
The  exodus was taking place; the people were going to Canada, where they  enjoyed sane conditions under which people could live.
They were going  to Canada, instead of going to hostile countries, as they had done in  the past.
Canada was getting a good many of such people, but not half enough;  and if she had preferential tariffs in that sense, it would keep the  blood and bone and muscle in this country under the common flag: it  would keep them from helping to build up hostile nations, and would in  that way be a source of strength to the Empire.
He hoped that would  be considered an answer to his friends from Manchester, on the point  that there would be give and take, and not as had been said, simply  "take" on the part of the colonies.
He thought that was a most unfair  statement to make; but he had now presented the Canadian side of the  question.
Another extraordinary thing had happened.
A gentleman whom the people  of England had appointed to take control of English affairs with  reference to the colonies, had lately declared that the colonies ought  to make a treaty among themselves, leaving Great Britain out.
That  was rather a flippant way to meet offers of friendship, sympathy,  and loyalty.
Two hundred and seventy-four members of Parliament, he  believed, had written requesting that no preference should be given.
He desired to ask what had Great Britain done to those men that they  should want to prevent England getting an advantage?
Why should they  object?
Why should they interfere?
What had Great Britain ever done to  them?
His friend, Mr. Wilson, had told the delegates of the French  manufacturer who said, 'Why do you not come over and build your  factories in France?'
British factories were already being built on  the Continent to-day.
British factories, with British money, British  brains, British enterprise, and British intellect, were now being  built in the United States; but while that was the experience of  England, Canada, on the other hand, was able to say that United States  capital was being utilised in Canada and giving work to Canadian  workmen.
That was where Canada was reaping the advantage; and it was  not to be wondered at that the Canadian delegates came to England and  asked the English people to look about them.
When he was a young man he used to boat a good deal upon the Niagara  River, a mile above the Falls.
Two people always rowed together and  always had a spare pair of oars.
They had to row at an angle of 45  degrees, and row hard to get across without being carried into the  rapids.
They could not depend on their course by watching the river or  watching their own boat; they had to take a point on the shore, and  another point away beyond it, and keep them in line.
The instant they  stopped rowing, although the boat might appear to be perfectly calm  and safe, it was quietly drifting to destruction.
The Canadian people  were on the shore and were watching the British people in the stream.
The people of this country had their eyes on the oars and on the boat,  but were not watching the landmarks and outside currents.
They were  not watching what Germany or the United States were doing; they were  not watching how other nations were progressing.
In fact England was  going backwards.
If he were standing on the shore of the Niagara River  and saw a man stop rowing, he would shout to him to look out, and that  was what he was doing now.
Two gentlemen had spoken on behalf of the poor people in India, but  he would like to know whether those gentlemen were not much more  interested in the exchange of commerce between England and India than  they were in the internal comfort and happiness of the natives.
He  would also like to ask who put on and took off the duty in India?
Was it not done through the influence of the English Government?
Why  was such a large duty placed on tea, and why was it not taken off tea  and put on wheat?
If the duty were taken off tea, it would not cost  the working man a farthing more, and the result would be that the  Indian farmers and agriculturists would probably obtain some slight  advantage, but the Indian tea worker would get a direct and positive  advantage.
Both parties would be helped by it, and it would also help  at the same time the whole Empire.
An extract had been read from a speech by Sir Wilfrid Laurier, the  Prime Minister of Canada.
Sir Wilfrid seven or eight years ago might  have made a remark of that kind, and it so happened that he was in  very bad company at the time, because the remarks were made at the  Cobden Club.
In Canada, prominent men such as Sir Wilfrid Laurier were  able to understand and listen to good arguments, to assimilate them  and to change their minds.
But Sir Wilfrid at the last conference made  a plain and distinct offer, which he had repeated in public, and yet  he (the speaker) heard political partisans in this country in their  newspapers making the statement that Canada had made no offer.
It was  not true!
The offers were in the report of the Imperial Conference  of 1902; that he would give the present preference and a further  preference on a certain list of selected articles, if the English  people would meet him.
The long list of articles was not mentioned  because it would be improper to do so, as it would have the effect of  making the business of Canada unsettled in reference to those things.
But that the offer was made was an undoubted fact, and people in this  country had no right to make statements to the contrary.
He desired to make one final appeal to Englishmen to look at the  matter broadly; and when they found that the security and unity of the  whole Empire might depend upon closer federation with the colonies, he  appealed to English people not to make such flippant remarks as that  the colonies should make an agreement among themselves leaving out the  Mother Country, because if that were done, and a preferential tariff  instituted among the colonies, the Mother Country would very soon find  out the difference.
He appealed to Englishmen as a Canadian, the whole  history of whose country was filled with records of devotion to the  Empire, not to think that they were acting in any way for themselves,  or for their personal interests, but only in the interests of their  great Empire, which their fathers helped to build, and which they,  the children, desired to hand down unimpaired and stronger to their  children and children's children.
The vote was not taken until the next day, and when the show of hands was taken I think we had five or six to one in our favour.
A demand was made for a vote by Chambers with the result that 103 voted for the resolution, 41 against it, and 21 neutral.
The reason so much larger a number appeared with us on a show of hands was, I believe, because many Chambers had given cast iron instructions to their delegates to vote against it, or to vote neutral, but on a show of hands many of them voted as they personally felt after hearing the arguments.
This was a remarkable triumph that we did not expect, and must have been very gratifying to Mr. Chamberlain.
Unfortunately Mr. Chamberlain's illness took place just as the Congress opened.
It was thought at the time that he would recover in a few days, but he has not as yet been able to resume active leadership in the struggle for preferential tariffs or tariff reform.
As far as the work of our organisation is concerned, although we were at first ridiculed and abused, criticised and caricatured, the force of the arguments and the innate loyalty of the Canadian people, have caused the feeling in favour of imperial unity and preferential trade to become almost universal in Canada.
The preference has been established, West Indian Sugar favoured, penny postage secured, the Pacific Cable constructed, assistance given in the South African War in the imperial interest, and now the whole question remains to be decided in the Mother Country.
The colonies have all followed Canada's lead.
The conference of 1907 was futile.
Sir Wilfrid Laurier took the dignified course of repeating his offers made in 1902, and saying that the question now rested in the hands of the British people.
The British Government declined to do anything, which in view of the elections of the previous year was only to be expected, but a good deal of ill feeling was unnecessarily created by the action of one member of the Government, who offensively boasted that they had slammed, banged, and barred the door in the face of the colonies.
We still feel however that this view will not represent the sober second thought of the British people.
If it does, of course our hopes of maintaining the permanent unity of the Empire may not be realised.
From the Canadian standpoint I feel that enough has been said in the foregoing pages, to show that there was a widespread movement, participated in by people of both sides of the boundary line, which would soon have become a serious menace to Canada's connection with the Empire, had it not been for the vigorous efforts of the loyalist element to counteract it.
To the active share in which I took part in these efforts, I shall ever look back with satisfaction.
Not many years have passed, but the change in the last twenty years, has been a remarkable one, the movement then making such headway towards commercial union or annexation being now to all seeming completely dead.
Nor should it be forgotten that it is to the Liberal party, a great many of whose leading members took part in the agitation for Unrestricted Reciprocity, that we owe, since they came into power, the tariff preference to the Mother Country, and the other movements which I have mentioned above, which tend to draw closer the bonds of Empire.
It would be difficult now to find in Canada any Canadians who are in favour of continental union, many of those who formerly favoured it, being now outspoken advocates of British connection, looking back with wonder as to how they then were carried away by such an ill-judged movement.
Nevertheless the lesson taught by this period of danger is clear.
We must not forget, that with a powerful neighbour alongside of Canada, speaking the same language, and with necessarily intimate commercial intercourse, an agitation for closer relations, leading to ultimate absorption, is easy to kindle, and being so plausible, might spread with dangerous rapidity.
This is a danger that those both in Canada and Great Britain, who are concerned in the future of the British Empire, would do well to take to heart, and by strengthening the bonds of Empire avert such dangers for the future.
I am very glad to have the opportunity of saying a few words this evening.
I have listened to the discussion and I find there is a feeling that of all the Colonies Canada is the only one which is not doing her duty.
I have heard the doubt expressed as to whether Canada would, in case of serious trouble, stand by the Empire in the defence of her own frontiers.
In support of this view I have heard an opinion quoted of an Englishman who was dissatisfied with this country and left it for the United States; dissatisfied there also he went to Canada, where he is now equally dissatisfied and is agitating to break up this Empire.
I utterly repudiate his opinions.
He is no Canadian and does not express the views of my countrymen.
You have generally large numbers of Australians, New Zealanders and Cape Colonists at these meetings, but it is not always that you have Canadians present, and I do not think that we have altogether had fair play in this matter.
It seems to be popular to compliment the other Colonies, while the doubt is expressed as to whether the Canadian people would fight to keep Canada in the Empire.
I am astonished to hear such a reflection upon my country.
Our whole history is a standing protest against any such insinuation.
Let me recall a few facts in our past history, facts which show whether Canadians have not been true to this country.
Why our very foundation was based upon loyalty to the Empire.
Our fathers fought for a united Empire in the revolution of 1776.
They fought to retain the southern half of North America under the monarchy.
Bereft of everything, bleeding from the wounds of seven long years of war, carrying with them nothing but their loyalty, they went to Canada and settled in the wilderness.
Thirty years later, in 1812, in a quarrel caused by acts of British vessels on the high seas far from Canada--a quarrel in which they had no interest--the Canadian people (every able-bodied man) fought for three long years by the side of the British troops, and all along our frontier are dotted the battlefields in which lie buried large numbers of Canadians, who died fighting to retain the northern half of the continent in our Empire.
And yet I come here to London and hear it said that my countrymen won't stand true to the Empire.
Again, in 1837, a dissatisfied Scotchman raised a rebellion, but the Canadian people rose at once and crushed it out of sight before it could come to a head.
The people poured into Toronto in such numbers to support the Queen's authority, that Sir Francis Head, the Governor, had to issue a proclamation telling the people to stay at their homes, as they were gathering in such numbers they could not be fed.
In the Trent affair--no quarrel of ours; an event which occurred a thousand miles from our shores--every able-bodied man was ready to fight; our country was like an armed camp, the young and the old men drilling, no man complaining that it was not our quarrel, and the determined and loyal spirit of the Canadian people saved this country then from war.
So also in the Fenian Raid; again no quarrel of ours, for surely we have had nothing to do with the government of Ireland, and were not responsible in any way.
Yet it was our militia that bore the brunt of that trouble.
The lives lost in that affair were the lives of Canadian volunteers who died fighting in an Imperial quarrel.
This affair cost us millions of dollars, and did we ever ask you to recoup us?
And I, a Canadian volunteer, come here to London to hear the doubt expressed as to whether my countrymen would stand true to the Empire.
It is not fair, gentlemen; it is not right.
For the spirit of our people is the same to-day.
I have also heard the statement made this evening that there were no proper arrangements for the Nova Scotia militia to help in the defence of Halifax, as if there might be a doubt whether they would assist the Imperial troops to defend Halifax.
This is not fair to my comrades of the sister Province of Nova Scotia.
Let me recall an incident in the history of that Province at the time of the Maine boundary difficulty.
I allude to the occasion--many of you will remember it--when an English diplomatist, being humbugged with a false map, allowed the Yankees to swindle us out of half the State of Maine.
Well, at that time, Governor Fairfield, of the State of Maine, ordered out all the militia of that State to invade New Brunswick.
The Nova Scotian Legislature at once passed a resolution placing every dollar of their revenue, and every able-bodied man in the country, at the disposal of their sister Province of New Brunswick.
This vote was carried unanimously with three cheers for the Queen; and their bold and determined stand once more saved the Empire from war--(cheers)--and yet I, an Ontario man, come here to England, to hear the doubt expressed as to whether the militia of our sister Province of Nova Scotia would help to defend their own capital city in case of attack.
It is not fair, gentlemen, and I am glad to be here to-night to speak for my sister Province.
However, I cannot blame you for not understanding all these things.
You have not all been in Canada and even if any of you were to come to the Niagara Falls and cross from the States to look at them from the Canadian side, you would not return to the States knowing all about Canada.
It would not qualify you to be an authority on Canadian affairs.
(Laughter and applause.)
Now our position is peculiar.
We have a new country with illimitable territory--you can have no conception of the enormous extent--a territory forty times the size of Great Britain, and fifteen times the size of the German Empire, and we have only a small population.
We are opening up this country for settlement, developing its resources, and thereby adding to the power of the Empire.
Our burdens are enormous for our population and our wealth.
What have we done quite lately?
We have spent something like $150,000,000--£30,000,000--in constructing a railway across the continent and giving you an alternative route to the East.
Many people thought this would be too great a burden--more than our country could stand--but our Government and the majority of our people took this view, that this scheme would supply a great alternative route to the East, bring trade to the country, add strength to the Empire, and make us more than ever a necessity and a benefit to the Empire.
And remember, all the time we are developing our country, all the time we are spending these enormous sums, we do not live in the luxury you do here, and while we are perfectly willing to do a great deal, we cannot do everything all at once.
With you everything is reversed.
You have had nearly 2,000 years start, with your little bit of country, and your large population, and by this time I must say you have got it pretty well fixed up.
(Laughter.)
The other day I was travelling through Kent and I was reminded of the remark of the Yankee who said of it: "It appears to me this country is cultivated with a pair of scissors and a fine comb."
We have not had the time or the population to do this, and we cannot afford a standing army.
It is not fair to find fault with us because we do not keep up a standing army.
It is absolutely necessary we should not take away from productive labour too large a number of men to idle about garrison towns.
The Canadian people know that as things stand at present, they cannot be attacked by any nation except the United States.
We would not be afraid of facing any European or distant Power, simply because the difficulties of sending a distant maritime expedition are recognised to be so tremendous.
Suppose war should unfortunately break out with the United States--and that, as I say, is the only contingency we need seriously consider--in that case, what are we to do?
It would be useless we know to attempt to defend our country with a small standing army.
We know that every able-bodied man would have to fight.
We know that our men are able and willing to fight, and what we are trying to do is to educate officers.
Our military college, kept up at large expense, is one of the finest in the world.
Then we have permanent schools for military purposes, men drafted from our corps being drilled there and sent back to instruct.
We keep up about 38,000 active militia, and the country has numbers of drilled men who could be relied on.
As an illustration of our system, I may mention that in 1866 there was a sudden alarm of a Fenian invasion.
The Adjutant-General received orders at 4 o'clock in the afternoon to turn out 10,000 men.
At eleven the next day the returns came in, and to his utter astonishment he found there were 14,000 under arms.
The reason was that the old men who had gone through the corps had put on their old uniforms, taken down their rifles, and turned out with their comrades, and there they were ready to march.
Instead of the militia force going down, it is, I think, slightly increasing.
Our force could be easily expanded in case of trouble.
If there were danger of war, and the Government were to say to me to-morrow: "Increase your regiment of cavalry and double it," I believe it could be done in twenty-four hours.
I cannot tell you how many stand of arms we have in the country, but I believe there are three or four times as many rifles as would arm the present militia force, and therefore there would be no difficulty on that score.
In case of a great war, it would, of course, be necessary to get assistance from England.
We certainly should want that assistance in arms and ammunition.
We have already established an ammunition factory, which is capable of great extension.
We have a great many more field guns that we are absolutely using.
It would be an easy thing to double the field batteries with retired men.
Further, there is a good deal of voluntary drill, and I may say, speaking from my experience in the North-West campaign, that I would just as soon have good volunteer regiments as permanent forces.
They may not be quite so well drilled, but they possess greater intelligence and greater zeal and enthusiasm.
If any trouble should come, I am quite satisfied you will not find any backwardness on the part of the Canadian people in doing their full duty.
At the present time, considering the enormous expense of developing the country and of, in other ways, making it great and powerful, it would, I think, be a pity to waste more than is absolutely necessary in keeping up a large military force.
The training of officers, the providing of an organisation and machinery, the encouragement of a confident spirit in the people, and a feeling of loyalty to the Empire--these are, I venture to say, the principal things, of more importance than a small standing army.
(Applause.)
The Chairman (the Right Hon.
Childers).--You will all, I think, agree that it is rather fortunate the few remarks by previous speakers have elicited so eloquent and powerful an address as that we have just listened to.
The record of the dim past, so great is the distance from which we look and so scanty the materials of history, seems almost a kaleidoscope, in which one dominant race rises into greatness and strength upon the ruins of another, each in turn luxuriating in affluence and power, each in turn going to ruin and decay.
In the earliest period, when Europe was peopled by barbarians, we read of Egypt, of its power, its wealth, and its civilisation.
Travellers to-day, standing in the ruins of Thebes and Memphis, view with amazement the architectural wonders of the gigantic ruins, and draw comparisons between what the race of ancient Egyptians must have been, and the poor Arab peasants who live in wretched huts among the _debris_ of former grandeur.
The Assyrian empire has also left a record of its greatness and civilisation.
Their sculptures show a race of sturdy heroes, with haughty looks and proud mien, evidently the leaders of a dominant race.
The luxuriant costumes, the proud processions, the ceremonious _cortège_ of the Assyrian monarchs, all find their place in the sculptures of Nineveh, while their colossal dimensions indicate the magnificence of the halls and galleries in which they were placed.
These broken stones, dug from the desert, are all that is left to tell us of a great and dominant race for ever passed away.
The Persian empire came afterwards into prominence, and was a mighty power when in its prime.
The Phœnicians, by their maritime enterprise and their roving and energetic spirit, acquired great power.
Their influence was felt as far as England.
Their chief cities, Tyre and Sidon, were at one time the most wealthy and powerful cities in the world, excelling in all the arts and sciences.
To-day ruin and desolation mark their sites, and testify to the truth of the awful prophecy of Ezekiel the prophet.
The Greeks and Romans were also dominant races, but the small republics of Greece frittered away in dissension and petty civil wars the energy and daring that might have made Athens the mistress of the world.
Rome, on the other hand, was more practical.
The Roman was filled with a desire for national supremacy.
He determined that Rome should be the mistress of the world, and the desire worked out its fulfilment.
The Carthaginians rose and fell, victims to the greater vigour and energy of their indomitable rivals the Romans.
After the fall of the Roman Empire of the East, the Mohammedan power, restless, warlike, and fanatical, quickly overran Asia Minor and Turkey, and threatened at one time the conquest of all Europe.
Three hundred years ago Spain was the all-powerful country.
Her ships whitened every sea, her language was spoken in every clime, her coins were the only money used by traders beyond the equator.
England, which was at that time the sole home of English-speaking people, was only a fifth or sixth-rate Power.
To-day the British Empire is the greatest empire the world has ever seen, with 11,214,000 square miles of territory, a population of 361,276,000, a revenue of £212,800,000, total imports and exports of £1,174,000,000, and she owns nearly one-half of the shipping of the world.
In considering the causes which lead to the rise and fall of nations, we find that the first requisite to ensure national greatness is a national sentiment--that is, a patriotic feeling in the individual, and a general confidence of all in the future of the State.
This national spirit generally exhibits itself in military prowess, in a determination of placing the country first, self afterwards; of being willing to undergo hardships, privation, and want; and to risk life, and even to lay down life, on behalf of the State.
I can find no record in history of any nation obliterating itself, and giving up its nationality for the sake of making a few cents a dozen on its eggs, or a few cents a bushel on its grain.
The Egyptians commemorated the deeds of their great men, erected the greatest monuments of antiquity, and taught the people respect for their ancestors, holding the doctrine, "accursed is he who holds not the ashes of his fathers sacred, and forgets what is due from the living to the dead."
The Assyrians on their return from a successful war paraded the spoils and trophies of victory through their capital.
They also recorded their warlike triumphs in inscriptions and sculptures that have commemorated the events and preserved the knowledge of them to us to this present day.
The national spirit of the Greeks was of the highest type.
490, the Athenians without hesitation boldly faced their enemies.
Every man who could bear arms was enlisted, and 10,000 free men on the plains of Marathon completely routed the enormous horde of invaders.
This victory was celebrated by the Greeks in every possible way.
Pictures were painted, and poems were written about it.
One hundred and ninety-two Athenians who fell in action were buried under a lofty mound which may still be seen, and their names were inscribed on ten pillars, one for each tribe.
Six hundred years after the battle, Pausanias the historian was able to read on the pillars the names of the dead heroes.
The anniversary of the battle was commemorated by an annual ceremony down to the time of Plutarch.
After the death of Miltiades, who commanded the Greeks, an imposing monument was erected in his honour on the battlefield, remains of which can still be traced.
This victory and the honour paid both the living and the dead who took part in it, had a great influence on the Greeks, and increased the national spirit and confidence of the people in their country.
The heavy strain came upon them ten years later, when Xerxes invaded Greece with what is supposed to have been the greatest army that ever was gathered together.
Such an immense host could not fail to cause alarm among the Greeks, but they had no thought of submission.
The national spirit of a race never shone out more brightly.
Leonidas, with only 4,000 troops all told, defended the pass at Thermopylæ for three days against this immense host, and when, through the treachery of a Greek named Ephialtes, the Persians threatened his retreat, Leonidas and his Spartans would not fly, but sending away most of their allies, he remained there and died with his people for the honour of the country.
They were buried on the spot, and a monument erected with the inscription:      Go, stranger, and to Lacedæmon tell     That here, obedient to her laws, we fell.
Six hundred years after, Pausanias read on a pillar erected to their memory in their native city, the names of 300 Spartans who died at Thermopylæ.
A stone lion was erected in the pass to the memory of Leonidas, and a monument to the dead of the allies with this inscription: "Four thousand from the Peloponnesus once fought on this spot with three millions."
Another monument bore the inscription: "This is the monument of the illustrious Megistias whom the Medes, having passed the river Sperchius, slew--a prophet who, at the time, well knowing the impending fate, would not abandon the leaders of Sparta."
The Athenians were compelled to abandon their homes and take refuge on the island of Salamis, where the great battle was fought the following October, between 380 Greek vessels and a Persian fleet of 2,000 vessels.
This action was brought on by a stratagem of Themistocles, whom no odds seemed to discourage.
This ended in a great victory for the Greeks, and practically decided the fate of the war.
Themistocles and Eurybiades were presented with olive crowns, and other honours were heaped upon them.
Ten months after this Mardonius a second time took possession of the city, and the Athenians were again fugitives on the island of Salamis; even then the Athenians would not lose hope.
Only one man in the council dared to propose that they should yield; when he had left the council-chamber the people stoned him to death.
Mardonius, who had an army of 300,000 men and the power of the Persian empire at his back, offered them most favourable terms, but the national spirit of the Greeks saved them when the outlook was practically hopeless.
The Athenians replied that they would never yield while the sun continued in its course, but trusting in their gods and in their heroes, they would go out and oppose him.
Shortly after the Greeks did go out, and a brilliant victory was won at Platæa, where Mardonius and nearly all his army were killed.
The Mantineans and the Elians arrived too late to take part in the action with the other Greeks, and were so mortified at the delay that they banished their generals on account of it.
Thus ended the Persian invasions of Greece.
The national spirit of the Greeks inspired them to the greatest sacrifices and the greatest heroism, and was the foundation of the confidence and hope that never failed them in the darkest hour.
There were a few traitors such as Ephialtes, who betrayed the pass, and a few pessimists like Lycidas, who lost hope and was stoned to death for speaking of surrender.
The lesson is taught, however, that the existence in a community of a few emasculated traitors and pessimists is no proof that the mass of the citizens may not be filled with the highest and purest national spirit.
The history of Rome teaches us the same great lesson.
As Rome was once mistress of the world, as no race or nationality ever before wielded the power or attained the towering position of Rome, so we find that just as in proportion she rose to a higher altitude than any other community, so does her early history teem with the records of a purer national sentiment, a more perfect patriotism, a greater confidence in the State on the part of her citizens, and a more enduring self-sacrificing heroism on the part of her young men.
Early Roman history is a romance filled with instances of patriotic devotion to the State that have made Roman virtues a proverb even to this day.
Many of the stories are, no doubt, mere legends, but they are woven into the history of the nation, and were evidently taught to the children to create and stimulate a strong patriotic sentiment in their breasts.
When we read the old legend of Horatius at the bridge; when we read of Quintus Curtius, clad in complete armour and mounted on his horse, plunging into the yawning gulf in the Forum to save the State from impending destruction; when we read of Mutius Scævola, of Regulus, urging his countrymen to continue the war with Carthage, and then returning to the death which was threatened him if he did not succeed in effecting a peace, we can form some idea of the spirit which animated this people, and can no longer wonder at such a race securing such a world-wide supremacy.
The Romans took every means to encourage this feeling and to reward services to the State.
Horatius Cocles was crowned on his return, his statue erected in the temple of Vulcan, and a large tract of the public land given him.
Rome was filled with the statues, and columns, and triumphal arches, erected in honour of great services performed for the State.
Many of these monuments are still standing.
Varro, after the terrible defeat of Cannæ, received the thanks of the Senate because, although defeated and a fugitive, he had not despaired of the future of the State.
The Romans, like the English, never knew when they were beaten, and disaster rarely inclined them to make peace.
They did not look upon Carthage, their neighbour to the south, as their natural market, not at least to the extent of inducing them to give up their nationality in the hope of getting rich by trading with that community, and yet history leads us to believe that Carthage was at one time very wealthy and prosperous.
No, the national sentiment was the dominant idea.
For Romans in Rome's quarrel       Spared neither land nor gold,     Nor son, nor wife, nor limb, nor life,       In the brave days of old.
Even the Romans, however, had traitors, for we read that Brutus ordered the execution of his own sons for treason.
Catiline also conspired against the State; of course his character was not good; he was said to be guilty of almost every crime in the calendar, but when you are picking out specimen traitors it is difficult to be fastidious about their personal character.
The national spirit of the race, however, easily overcame all the bad influences of the disloyal, and it was only when this sentiment died out, and luxury, selfishness, and poltroonery took its place, that Rome was overthrown.
The experience of the ancients has been repeated in later times.
The national spirit of the Swiss has carried Switzerland through the greatest trials, and preserved her freedom and independence in the heart of Europe for hundreds of years.
No principle of continental unity has been able to destroy her freedom.
The Swiss confederation took its origin in the oath on the Rutli in 1307, and eight years later at Morgarten, the Marathon of Switzerland, 1,300 Swiss peasants defeated an army of 20,000 Austrians.
This inspired the whole people, and commenced the series of brilliant victories which for two centuries improved the military skill, stimulated the national spirit, and secured the continued freedom of the Swiss nation.
In 1386 another great victory was won at Sempach, through the devotion of Arnold of Winkelried, whose story of self-sacrifice is a household word taught to the children, and indelibly written on grateful Swiss hearts.
The memory of Winkelried will ever remain to them as an inspiration whenever danger threatens the fatherland.
A chapel marks the site of the battle, the anniversary is celebrated every year, while at Stanz a beautiful monument commemorates Winkelried's noble deed.
In 1886 the five hundredth anniversary of Sempach was celebrated by the foundation of the Winkelried Institution for poor soldiers and the relatives of those killed in action.
In 1388 a small army of Swiss, at Naefels, completely defeated, with fearful loss, ten times their number of Austrians, and secured finally the freedom of Switzerland.
A history published last year says:   "Year after year the people of Glarus, rich and poor alike,  Protestant and Catholic, still commemorate this great victory.
On  the first Thursday in April, in solemn procession, they revisit the  battlefield, and on the spot the Landammann tells the fine old story  of their deliverance from foreign rule, while priest and minister  offer thanksgiving.
The 5th April, 1888, was a memorable date in  the annals of the canton, being the five hundredth anniversary of  the day on which the people achieved freedom.
From all parts of  Switzerland people flocked to Naefels to participate in the patriotic  and religious ceremonies.
A right stirring scene it was when the  Landammann presented to the vast assembly the banner of St. Fridolin,  the same which Ambuhl had raised high, and thousands of voices joined  in the national anthem."
A magnificent monument at Basle commemorates the bloody fight of St. Jacques.
The national spirit of the Swiss, nurtured and evidenced in this manner, has held together for hundreds of years a people professing different religions, and actually speaking four different languages.
of Prussia threatened them with war.
The whole people rose; grey-haired old men and mere boys offered their services, fellow-countrymen abroad sent large sums of money, and even the school children offered up their savings, and there was no intruding traitor to object that the children should not be allowed to interfere on the pretext that it was a party question.
Catholic and Protestant, French, German, Italian, and Romansch, all stood shoulder to shoulder, animated by the same spirit, determined to brave any danger in defence of the honour and independence of their country.
The noble bearing of the Swiss aroused the sympathy and commanded the respect of all Europe, and really caused the preservation of peace.
They have been free for 500 years, and will be free and respected so long as they retain the national spirit they have hitherto possessed.
It is interesting to note that the Swiss teach the boys in the schools military drill, furnishing them with small guns and small cannon that they may be thoroughly trained.
Russia has grown from a comparatively small principality to an enormous empire, and as it has constantly risen in the scale of nations, so has it also been marked by a strong sentiment of nationality.
Alexander, Prince of Novgorod, in 1240 and 1242 won two great victories, one at the Neva and the other at Lake Peipus, and so saved Russia from her enemies.
He received the honourable title of "Nefsky," or of the Neva, and the anniversaries of his victories were celebrated for hundreds of years.
The great Alexander Nefsky monastery in St. Petersburg was built in his honour by Peter the Great.
Dimitry, in 1380, won a great victory over the Tartars.
Over 500 years have elapsed, but still the name of Dimitry Donskoi lives in the memory and in the songs of the Russian people, and still on "Dimitry's Saturday," the anniversary of the battle, solemn prayers are offered up in memory of the brave men who fell on that day in defence of the fatherland.
It is hardly necessary to refer to the magnificent display of patriotism and self-sacrifice shown by the whole Russian people, from Czar to serf, in the defence of Russia in 1812, against armed Europe led by the greatest general of modern times.
The spirit of the Russians rose with their sacrifices.
The destruction of Moscow by its own people is one of the most striking instances of patriotic devotion in history.
The Governor of Moscow, Count Rostopchin, burned his own country palace near Moscow when the French approached, and affixed to the gates this inscription: "During eight years I have embellished this country house, and lived happily in it in the bosom of my family.
The inhabitants of this estate--7,000--quit at your approach.
You find nothing but ashes."
The city was abandoned and burnt.
Nothing remained but the remembrance of its glories and the thirst for a vengeance, which was terrible and swift.
Kutusof, the Russian general, announced the loss, and said "that the people are the soul of the empire, and that where they are there is Moscow and the empire of Russia."
The magnificent column to Alexander I. in the square in front of the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg is a striking memorial of the victor of this great war.
A visitor to St. Petersburg cannot fail to notice the strong pride in their country that animates the people.
Now turning to England we find numberless proofs of the same sentiment that has built up all great nations.
The brilliant victories of Cressy, Poitiers, and Agincourt, won by Englishmen against overwhelming odds, had no doubt exercised an important influence upon the people.
The Reformation and the discovery of the New World exercised the popular mind, and a spirit of adventure seized most of the European countries.
English sailors were most active and bold in their seafaring enterprises.
They waged private war on their own account against the Spaniards in the West Indies and in the southern seas, and attacked and fought Spanish vessels with the most reckless indifference as to odds.
The Armada set a spark to the smouldering patriotism of the people, the whole nation sprang to arms, the City of London equipped double the number of war vessels they were called upon to furnish.
Catholics and Protestants vied with each other in animating the people to the most vehement resistance.
To excite the martial spirit of the nation Queen Elizabeth rode on horseback through her army, exhorting them to remember their duty to their country.
"I am come amongst you," she said, "being resolved in the midst and heat of the battle to live and die amongst you all, to lay down, for my God, and for my kingdom, and for my people, my honour, and my blood even in the dust.
I know I have the body of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart of a king, and a king of England, too, and think foul scorn that Parma, Spain, or any prince of Europe should dare to invade the borders of my realms."
These noble sentiments show the feeling that animated the race, for no woman could speak in such a strain who had not lived and breathed in an atmosphere of brave and true patriotism.
Elizabeth voiced the feeling of her people, and this strong national spirit carried England through the greatest danger that ever menaced her.
The poems of Shakespeare ring with the same loyal sentiment:      This England never did (nor never shall)     Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror,     But when it first did help to wound itself     Now these her princes have come home again,     Come the three corners of the world in arms.
And we shall shock them: Nought shall make us rue     If England to itself do rest but true.
The three hundredth anniversary of the defeat of the Armada was celebrated at Plymouth three years ago, and a magnificent monument erected on the Hoe, close to the statue of the brave old English sailor, Sir Francis Drake, who did so much to secure the victory.
The great poets of England have voiced the patriotic feeling of the country in every age.
Macaulay's "Armada," Tennyson's "Revenge," and "The Light Brigade"; the songs of Campbell and Dibdin are household words in our empire, and I never heard of any objection being made to their being read by children.
The confidence of England in herself carried her through the terrible struggle with the French, Spaniards, and Dutch, in which she lost the American Colonies.
Her patriotic determination also carried her through the desperate struggle with Napoleon, who at one time had subdued nearly every other European country to his will.
While the English people are animated by the spirit of Drake and Frobisher, of Havelock and Gordon, of Grenville and Nelson, of the men who fought at Rorke's Drift, or those who rode into the valley of death, there need be no fear as to her safety.
Our own short Canadian history gives us many bright pages to look back upon.
The exodus of the United Empire Loyalists was an instance of patriotic devotion to the national idea that is almost unique in its way.
The manly and vigorous way in which about 300,000 Canadians in 1812 defended their country against the attacks of a nation of 8,000,000, with only slight assistance from England, then engaged in a desperate war, is too well known to require more than the merest reference.
It is well to notice, however, how the experience of all nations has been repeated in our own country.
We were hampered and endangered in 1812 by the intrigues of traitors, some of whom in Parliament did all they could to embarrass and destroy the country, and then deserted to the enemy and fought against us.
General Brock's address to the Canadian people, however, shows the same national confidence that has carried all great nations through their greatest trials.
"We are engaged," said he, "in an awful and eventful contest.
By unanimity and despatch in our councils and by vigour in our operations we may teach the enemy this lesson, that a country defended by free men enthusiastically devoted to the cause of their king and constitution can never be conquered."
The memory of our victories at Queenston Heights and Chateauguay are as dear to the hearts of the Canadian people as Marathon and Salamis were to the Greeks, or Morgarten and Sempach are to the Swiss.
Why then should we be asked to conceal the knowledge of these victories won on our own soil, by our own people, in defence of our own freedom?
Confederation united the scattered provinces, extended our borders from ocean to ocean, gave us a country and a name, filled the minds of our youth with dreams of national greatness and hopes of an extending commerce spreading from our Atlantic and Pacific coasts to every corner in the world.
The completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway consolidated the country more than ever, brought the provinces into closer union, and inspired the hope that a great portion of the trade between the East and the West would pulsate through our territory.
All these causes have created a strong national spirit.
This feeling was dormant until the people became uneasy about an insidious movement commenced four years ago in New York, which, while apparently advocated in the interest of Canada, would have resulted in the loss of our fiscal independence and possibly our national existence.
This was followed by President Cleveland's retaliation proclamation, a blow intended to embarrass our affairs, and so to force us into subserviency.
Afterwards came Senator Sherman's speech, strongly advocating annexation; and Mr. Whitney, the Secretary of the Navy, threatened us with an invasion, describing how four armies of 25,000 men each could easily take Canada.
The newspapers in the States were filled with articles on the subject, and maps were published showing our country divided up into states, and its very name obliterated.
As an instance of the newspaper articles I quote the following from the New York _Commercial Bulletin_, published in November, 1888, commenting on the speeches of Senator Sherman and Mr. Whitney.
The _Bulletin_ says:   "Both are inimical to commercial union unless it also be complemented  by political union, or, to phrase it more plainly, they insist  that annexation of Canada to the United States can afford the  only effective guarantee of satisfactory relations between the  two countries, if these are to be permanent.
These prominent men,  representing each of the great parties that have alternately the  administration of this Government in their hands, we are persuaded  did not put forth these views at random, but that they voiced the  views of other political leaders, their associates, who are aiming at  making Canadian annexation the leading issue at the next Presidential  election.
As if speaking for the Republicans, Senator Sherman, as has  already been shown, thinks the country now ready for the question,  while Secretary Whitney, as if speaking for the other political party,  is not less eager to bring the country face to face with it, even at  the risk of war with England."
The _North American Review_, one of the most respectable of their magazines, actually published an article by General Benjamin F. Butler, in which, speaking of annexation, he said: "Is not this the fate of Canada?
Peacefully we hope, forcefully if we must," and in the truculent spirit of a freebooter, he suggested that the invading army should be paid by dividing up our land among them.
This was followed by the McKinley Bill, aimed of course at all countries, but especially bearing upon the articles where Canada's trade could be seriously injured.
This portion of the bill is generally believed to have been prepared with the assistance and advice of traitors in our own country.
In face of all this a lecturer in this city a few weeks ago made the following statement:   "Let me say once more, that I have been going among the Americans now  for more than twenty years.
I have held intercourse with people of  all classes, parties, professions, characters, and ages, including  the youth of a university who are sure to speak as they feel.
I never  heard the slightest expression of a wish to aggress on Canada, or to  force her into the union."
Among the people of antiquity there was a race that inhabited Mysia, a portion of Asia Minor, lying next to the Hellespont.
This race was said to have been once warlike, but they soon degenerated, and acquired the reputation of being the meanest of all people, Mysorum ultimus or last of the Mysians being used as a most contemptuous epithet.
The ancients generally hired them to attend their funerals as mourners because they were naturally melancholy and inclined to shed tears.
I think that the last lingering remnant of that bygone race must have wandered into this country, and, unable to obtain employment in their natural vocation, mourn and wail over the fate of Canada, urge our people to commit national suicide, and use every effort to destroy that hope and confidence which a young country like our own should always possess.
This small clique is working in collusion with our enemies in the States, the design being to entrap us into annexation by force or fraud.
This threat upon our country's life, and the intrigues of these conspirators have had the effect that similar attempts have had upon all nations that have possessed the slightest elements of manliness.
The patriotic feeling at once became aroused, the clergy in their pulpits preached loyalty and patriotism, the people burst out into song, and patriotic poems of greater or less merit appeared in the local press everywhere.
The Stars and Stripes, often before draped in friendly folds with the Union Jack, disappeared from sight, while our own flag was hoisted all over the land.
Battle anniversaries were celebrated, military monuments decorated, and in all public gatherings the loyal sentiment of the people showed itself, not in hostility to the people of the United States, but in bitter contempt for the disloyal among ourselves, who were intriguing to betray the country.
This manifestation of the popular feeling killed the commercial union movement.
No party in Canadian politics would touch it, and the Commercial Union Club in this city is, I believe, defunct.
Its chairman, however, has not given up his designs against Canada.
Coming to Canada about twenty years ago, his first mission was to teach the Canadians those high principles of honour of which he wished them to believe he was the living embodiment.
His writings and his influence have never been on the side of the continued connection between Canada and the Empire, but it is only within the last year or two that he has thrown off the mask, and taking advantage of the movements in the States to coerce us into annexation has come out openly in favour of the idea under the name of Continental Unity.
In his last lecture on "Jingoism," given a few weeks ago, he made his political farewell.
If I placed the slightest confidence in his statement that he had concluded his attacks on Canada, I would not have troubled to answer this, his latest vindictive effusion.
But he has already made so many farewells that he calls to mind the numerous farewell performances of antiquated ballet dancers, who usually continue repeating them till they are hissed off the stage.
Before three weeks had elapsed he once more appeared before the public, with a letter announcing once more his departure from the stage, and arguing at length in favour of annexation for the purpose of influencing Mr. Solomon White's Woodstock meeting.
Mr. White's speech and his letter were the only words heard in favour of that view, in a meeting which by an overwhelming majority of both parties in politics, voted against the idea.
He will write again and lecture again if he sees any opportunity of doing Canada any injury.
This Oxford Professor has been most systematic in his efforts to carry out his treasonable ideas.
He sees several obstacles in his way.
The prosperity of the people, their loyalty to their sovereign, their love for the motherland, the idea of imperial unity, the memory of what we owe to the dead who have died for Canada's freedom, and the martial instinct of our young men which would lead them to fight to maintain the independence of their country.
He sees all these influences in his way, while the only inducement he can hold out to us in support of his view is the delusive hope that annexation would make us more prosperous and wealthy.
How getting a market among our competitors, who produce everything we sell and are our rivals everywhere, would enrich us is a difficult point to maintain, and as his forte is destruction and not construction, his main efforts are devoted to attacking all that stands in his way.
Without the same ability, he seems desirous of playing the part of a second Tom Paine in a new revolution, hoping to stab the mother country, and rob her empire of half a continent, as did that other renegade whose example he tries to imitate.
He never loses an opportunity to make Canadians dissatisfied with their lot, trying to make us believe that we are in a hopeless state, while in reality we are exceedingly prosperous.
In England he poses as a Liberal Unionist, which gives him a standpoint in that country from which he can attack Canada to the greatest advantage.
His book on the Canadian question was evidently written for the purpose of damaging this country in England.
One of his very few sympathisers said to me with a chuckle, "It will stop emigration to Canada for five years."
I need not devote time to this, however.
Principal Grant has exposed its inaccuracies and unfairness, and proved that this prophet of honour has been guilty of misrepresentations that would shame a fourth-rate Yankee politician.
In the London _Anti-Jacobin_ this summer he tells the English people to turn their attention to Africa, to India, and to Egypt, that there they have fields for achievement, and that other fields may be opened when the Turkish empire passes away, and asks the English people why they should cling to a merely nominal dominion.
He evidently longs to see Englishmen, and English treasure and English enterprise given to assist and develop India, Africa, Egypt, or Turkey, anywhere except Canada, which has given him a home and treated him with a forbearance and courtesy unparalleled.
The vindictive malignancy of this suggestion to the _Anti-Jacobin_ is manifest.
He sees that emigration to the magnificent wheat fields of our North-West will help and strengthen Canada, and so he decries Canada in his book and writes to English journals endeavouring to divert English enterprise and capital to countries inhabited by alien races about whose affairs and possibilities he knows nothing.
These are instances of his systematic intrigues against the prosperity of Canada.
In February last, to attack the innate loyalty of the people, he delivered to an organisation of young men in this city a lecture on "Loyalty."
The whole aim of the lecture was to throw ridicule upon the very idea.
A few men of bad character, who had claimed to be loyal, were quoted to insinuate that loyalty was synonymous with vice.
As I have in my lecture on the "United Empire Loyalists" sufficiently answered him on this point, I will pass on to the next which was on "Aristocracy."
The object of this lecture was to discredit aristocracy, to show that the aristocracy belong to England and to the Empire, and to try to arouse the democratic instincts of a democratic country like ours against British connection.
To weaken, if possible, the natural feeling of the people towards the land of their ancestors.
His last lecture, on "Jingoism," is the one I principally wish to deal with, as it is aimed at the other influences, which this Mysian desires to weaken in furtherance of his traitorous plans.
The main object is to strike at our national spirit, at the evidences of it, and at the causes which increase and nourish this sentiment.
He combines in a few words what he objects to: "Hoisting of flags, chanting martial songs, celebration of battle anniversaries, erection of military monuments, decoration of patriotic graves, arming and reviewing the very children in our public schools."
In his elegant way he says: "If Jingoism finds itself in need of all these stimulants, we shall begin to think it must be sick."
As a matter of fact, it is these manifestations of a Canadian national spirit that make him sick, to use his own elegant phrase.
He says, "Jingoism" originated in the music halls of London.
No feeling could have originated in that way in Canada.
We have neither the music halls nor the class of population he refers to.
With his usual inaccuracy and want of appreciation of historical teaching he fails to see that the national spirit in Canada has shown itself in exactly the same way as the same feeling has been exhibited in all great nations in all ages, and has been evoked by the same cause, viz.
national danger.
He speaks of protectionism coming back to us from the tomb of mediæval ignorance, forgetting that he helped to resurrect it in 1878 and gave the influence of his pen and voice to put that principle in power.
The volunteer movement, that embodiment of the martial instinct of our race, the outcome of the manly feeling of our youth to be willing to fight for the freedom and autonomy of their native land is another great element that stands in the way of the little gang of conspirators, and so our lecturer attacks the whole force.
As we have no standing army, he praises the regular soldiers, so as by innuendo the more forcibly to insult our volunteers; insinuates that it is something feminine in the character of our people that induces them to flirt with the scarlet and coquette with the steel.
This historian says the volunteer movement in England was no pastime, it was a serious effort to meet a threatened danger; but, unfortunately for his argument, the danger never came to anything.
And yet he ought to know that volunteers in England have never seen a shot fired in anger for over two hundred years, and that he was speaking to the citizens of a city, that have seen in every generation since it was founded dead comrades brought home for burial who had died in action for their country.
The loss of life and the hardships of the North-west campaign, the exposure to the bitter cold of winter storms, and the other sufferings of our Toronto lads on the north shore trip, of course, were only pastime, while the parading in the parks and commons of England, in the long summer evenings, has been a serious effort.
The erection of a monument at Lundy's Lane, unless it included honouring the aggressors who fought against us and tried to wrest from us our country, is described as "the meanness of unslaked hatred."
Are the monuments all over England, France, Germany, Russia, Switzerland, Rome, Greece and the United States all evidences of "the meanness of unslaked hatred"?
They have never hitherto been looked at in that light.
The professor, however, considering how he is always treating a country that has used him far better than he ever deserved, should be a first-class authority on the meanness of unslaked and unfounded hatred.
After twenty-five years the people of Toronto decorated the monument in honour of their dead volunteers, who died in defence of Canada in 1866.
There was not one word of swagger or fanfaronade, simply an honouring of the memory of the dead, and pointing out the lesson it taught to the living to be true to their country.
This is the cause of a sneer from this man, who seems to forget that those who fell in 1866 died for Canada.
What more could man do than give up his life in defence of his country?
And yet we, the people of Toronto, have to submit to these insults to the memory of our dead fellow-citizens.
An earnest protest is also made against teaching patriotism to our children in the public schools, making them nurseries, as he says, of party passion.
Of all the many instances of the false arguments and barefaced impertinence of this stranger, this is the worst.
What party in this country is disloyal?
What party is not interested in Canadian patriotism?
A few strangers, some like the Athenian Eschines, believed to be in the pay of the enemy, some actuated only by natural malignity, are trying to destroy Canada, and find the patriotic spirit of our people in the way.
These men have tried to hang on to the outskirts of a great and loyal party, and by the ill odour which attaches to them have injured the party, which longs to be quit of them.
When Goldwin Smith's letter was read at the Woodstock meeting another letter from the foremost Liberal leader in Canada was there advising the Liberal party to be true to its fidelity to the old flag, to vote down the resolutions of the conspirators, and to show that we were prepared to sacrifice something to retain the allegiance of this great Dominion to the sovereign we love.
I have never referred to this question without vouching for the loyalty of the great body of the Liberal party, and especially for the loyalty of my old leaders, the Hon.
George Brown, Mr. Mackenzie, Mr. Blake and Mr. Mowat.
And Mr. Mowat voiced the feeling of all true Canadians, for, thank God, this has not yet become a party question.
As is done in Switzerland, and as is universally done in the United States--and all honour to them for it--all parties will unite to teach our children to honour our own flag, to sing our own songs, to celebrate the anniversaries of our own battles, to learn our own history, and will endeavour to inspire them with a national spirit and a confidence in our future.
In all this, remember that we do not want war.
It is the last thing anyone wants.
These intrigues between traitors here and enemies in the States may betray us into war, but if it comes, it will not be the fault of the Canadian people, or the great mass of the right-thinking people of the United States.
We only want to be let alone.
We have everything a nation requires, we have an immense territory and resources, we are as free as air, with as good institutions as any country in the world.
We do not wish to lose our nationality or to join a country for mere mercenary considerations where, in addition to a thousand other disadvantages, we would have to pay more as our share of the pension fund alone than the whole interest on our present national debt.
We have nothing whatever to fight for; we don't even require their market unless we can get it on equal and honourable terms.
We do not intend, as some advise, to kneel down in the gutter in front of our neighbour's place of business, and put up our hands and blubber and beg him to trade with us.
Such a course would be humiliating to the self-respect of a professional tramp.
A war could do us no good--could give us no advantage we do not now possess, save that it would rid us of our traitors.
It would be a fearful struggle, and, no matter how successful we might be, would bring untold loss and suffering upon our people.
This professor of history, who asks if we want war, ought to know that every attempt in the past to carry out his views has resulted in bloodshed.
In 1775 our people fought against the idea.
In 1812 they fought again in the same cause.
In 1837, in spite of real grievances, all was forgotten in the loyalty of the Canadians, and once more by bloodshed the feeling of the people was manifested.
On the 27th October, 1874, the _Globe_ editorially told him that what he was advocating simply meant revolution, and yet this man who is taking a course that he knows leads in the direction of war and bloodshed has the impudence to charge loyal men who are working in the opposite direction with wanting war.
The Swiss have for 500 years celebrated their battle anniversaries and honoured their flag and taught patriotism and military drill to their children.
Their whole male population is drilled, and yet no one charges them with being an aggressive or "jingo" race; no one ever dreams that they desire war.
It is a fallacious and childish argument to say that this kind of national spirit in itself indicates an aggressive feeling.
If so, the United States must be a most aggressive race, for no country waves her flag more persistently with cause or without; no country more generally decorates the graves of her dead soldiers, and no country is erecting so many military monuments, and I respect them for it.
By all means let us live on friendly terms with our neighbours, but certainly no people would despise us as much as they would were all Canadians so cowardly and contemptible as some sojourners here wish us to be.
The census returns seem to cause great satisfaction to our enemies.
The progress has not been as fast as some could wish, and the exodus of our people is much talked of.
The only trouble I find is that the exodus is not as extensive as it should be.
The man who cannot get on here, or who is dissatisfied with Canada or her institutions, is right to go to the country he likes best.
It does not cost much to go, and, if he wishes, by all means let him go.
The man to be despised is he who, dissatisfied here, remains here, and, using the vantage ground of residence in the country, exerts every effort to injure and destroy it.
If a few of this class would join the exodus, instead of doing all they can to increase it, it would be a blessing, and in the end increase materially both our population and our prosperity.
Strength does not consist so much in numbers as in quality.
When Hannibal was crossing into Italy he called for volunteers to stay behind to garrison some posts; not that he required them, but because he desired to rid himself of the half-hearted.
Some thousands volunteered to remain.
He then considered his army much stronger than when it was more numerous, because the weak element was gone.
Shakespeare, that great master of human nature, puts the same idea in Henry V.'s mouth on the eve of Agincourt, when in the face of fearful danger:                    Oh, do not wish one more;     Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host     That he who hath no stomach to this fight     Let him depart; his passport shall be made     And crowns for convoy put into his purse:     We would not die in that man's company     That fears his fellowship to die with us.
It is this very exodus of the dissatisfied from Canada that makes our people more united and determined.
We have about 5,000,000 of people anyway, about equal to the population of England when she faced Spain, about equal to the population of Prussia when, under Frederick the Great, she waged a triumphant war against a combination of Powers of about 100,000,000.
The remarks about the copyright law are really too funny.
The professor says that the anti-British feeling in the States is dying out, "and its death will be hastened by the International Copyright Law, because hitherto the unfair competition to which American writers were exposed with pirated English works has helped to embitter them against England."
Their hatred is not against their own countrymen, who, with the consent of the nation, have pirated English books, and sold them in competition against their native writings, but it is vented against the poor, innocent English author, whose property has been taken from him, much against his will and to his great loss.
There is not a man in all the United States who would imagine so mean an idea.
Space will not admit of answering one-half the misrepresentations and false arguments in this lecture on "Jingoism."
The utter indifference to facts and to the teachings of history, when they do not aid his arguments, gives this lecturer an advantage from which a more scrupulous writer is debarred.
Take for instance his reference to the calmness and freedom in the States during the civil war.
His statement that "civil law prevailed, personal liberty was enjoyed, the press was free, and criticised without reserve the acts of the Government and the conduct of the war" seems strange to any who remember the history of the time when Seward's "little bell" could put any citizen in the northern states in prison without warrant or trial; when Fort Lafayette in New York harbour, the old capitol at Washington, Fort McHenry at Baltimore, and Fort Warren at Boston were filled to overflowing with political prisoners; when newspapers were suspended and editors imprisoned, when Clement Vallandigham, one of the foremost men in the United States, was imprisoned and then banished for criticising the policy of the Government.
He speaks of his sympathy with the "Canada First" movement, of which I was one of the originators and for which I chose the motto "Canada First," the idea being that we were to put our country first, before all personal or party considerations.
We began our work by endeavouring to stir up and foster a national spirit.
Charles Mair wrote a series of letters from Fort Garry to the _Globe_ in 1869, before the North-West territories became part of Canada, advocating the opening of that country.
His letters were filled with the loyal Canadian spirit.
Robert G. Haliburton a year or two after went through the country lecturing on "Intercolonial Trade," and "The Men of the North," and teaching the same lesson.
Foster about the same time wrote his lecture on "Canada First," a magnificent appeal to Canadian patriotism, while I lectured in different parts of the Dominion on "The Duty of Canadians to Canada," urging the necessity of encouraging a strong national spirit in the people.
The professor says he gave the movement his sympathy and such assistance as he could with his pen.
He hoped, as did one or two others who injured us by their support, to turn it into an independence movement and make a sort of political party out of it, and it melted into thin air, but the work of the originators was not all lost, as Mair says in his lines in memory of our friend Foster:      The seed they sowed has sprung at last,     And grows and blossoms through the land.
The professor has in the same way been giving his sympathy and support to the Reform party, advocating trade arrangements somewhat as they do, and tacking on annexation, which they do not.
His assistance is blasting to the Reform party, and nothing but Mr. Mowat's manly repudiation of his ideas could save the party from the injury and damage that so unwelcome a guest could not fail to bring upon it.
For I have no doubt he is as unwelcome in the ranks of the Reform party as his presence in Canada is a source of regret to the whole population.
The last words of his lecture are as follows:   "But at last the inevitable will come.
It will come, and when it  does come it will not be an equal and honourable union.
It will be  annexation indeed."
With this last sneer, with this final insulting menace, this stranger bids us farewell, and only does so, partly because he thinks that in his book and in his lectures he has done all that he possibly can to injure our prosperity, to destroy our national spirit, to weaken our confidence in ourselves and in our country; and partly also to disarm criticism and somewhat allay the bitter feeling his disloyal enmity to Canada has aroused.
But we need not lose hope.
The instances I have given from the history of the past show that the very spirit that has carried great nations through great trials has manifested itself in all ages, just as the patriotic feeling of the Canadian people has burst out under the stress of foreign threats and foreign aggression, and under the indignation aroused by internal intrigue and treachery.
This feeling cannot be quenched.
Our flag will be hoisted as often as we will, and I am glad to notice that our judges are seeing that what is a general custom shall be a universal custom, and that where the Queen's courts are held there her flag shall float overhead.
All parties will unite in encouraging a national spirit, for no party can ever attain power in this country unless it is loyal.
Mr. Mowat shows this clearly in a second letter which has just been published in the _Globe_.
We will remember the deeds of our ancestors and strive to emulate their example.
Our volunteers will do their duty in spite of sneers, whether that duty be pastime or a serious effort.
We will strive to be good friends with our neighbours, and trade with them if they will, putting above all, however, the honour and independence of our country.
In Mr. Mowat's words:   "We will stand firm in our allegiance to the sovereign we love, and  will not forget the dear old land from which our fathers have come."
If all this is "Jingoism," the Canadians will be "Jingoes," as that loyal Canadian, Dr.
Beers, said in his magnificent lecture at Windsor.
We would rather be loyal Jingoes than disloyal poltroons.
If history teaches us anything, it teaches us that a sound national spirit alone can bring our native land to a prominent position among the nations of the earth; and if thus animated, what a strength this country will be to the British Empire, of which, I hope, we may ever form a part.
Let us then do everything to encourage this spirit.
Let all true Canadians think of Canada first, putting the country above all party or personal or pecuniary considerations, ever remembering that no matter what the dangers, or trials, or difficulties, or losses may be, we must never lose faith in Canada.
I will conclude with a few lines from one of "The Khan's" poems, which appeared not long since in one of our city papers, as they indicate the feeling that exists generally among native Canadians:      Shall the mothers that bore us bow the head       And blush for degenerate sons?
Are the patriot fires gone out and dead?
brothers, stand to the guns,     Let the flag be nailed to the mast       Defying the coming blast,     For Canada's sons are true as steel,       Their mettle is muscle and bone.
The Southerner never shall place his heel       On the men of the Northern Zone.
Oh, shall we shatter our ancient name,       And lower our patriot crest,     And leave a heritage dark with shame       To the infant upon the breast?
Nay, nay, and the answer blent       With a chorus is southward sent:     "Ye claim to be free, and so are we;       Let your fellow-freemen alone,     For a Southerner never shall place his heel       On the men of the Northern Zone."

The Empire Makers, by Hume Nesbit.
Africa is still the home of mystery, in spite of the many explorers who have revealed much of its wonders.
This romance is concerned mainly with the adventures of three young men who went out to South Africa, got into trouble with the Transvaal Government, and afterwards discovered an ancient nation in Central Africa.
On their return they were able to take a little hand in this present war of Justice and Right, where so many of our best and bravest are shedding their blood.
I wish I could have shown my readers the wind up of this vile oligarchy of Pretoria tyrants.
Yet I dare say no real Briton can doubt but that the end must be the triumph of our glorious Empire and the ultimate civilisation of those ignorant savages, the Boers.
It has cost us dearly--it may cost us more--yet never let a true lover of liberty be biased by the friends of the oppressors.
Africa must be a free country, as Australia, New Zealand, and Canada are.
Like those great countries, Africa must become a loyal and faithful daughter to her beneficent mother, our Empire, and enjoy the fruits of emancipation as those other sisters do.
These fruits are Liberty, Equality, Justice, and Fraternity to all races over which waves the glorious Red, White, and Blue Flag, the Union Jack.
The boons which we are at present fighting for will cause many a hearth to mourn for the brave sons who lie under the cold stars and the fierce suns of Africa.
But as the human parts of these sons enrich the veldt, so will their heroic actions cause countless generations of Boers to bless their coming.
They have fought--not out of revenge, but for duty and love of their brothers.
They have died for a noble cause, and Africa will yet think of them with pride.
While, therefore, we drop a tear over their sacred graves, let it be one of gratitude and pride.
Who would not sooner share the grave of a soldier in Africa than grasp the hand of a pro-Boer in England?
Who would not sooner lie beside a hero on the veldt than be placed near the statesman who caused all this waste of blood?
That you may forgive all the shortcomings in this book, and be interested in it and its pictures, is the most earnest wish of the writer.
Three braver, franker, and more chivalrous hearts never beat in male breasts than those that beat under the jackets of Ned Romer, Clarence Raybold, and Fred Weldon.
Ned Romer, the long-acknowledged hero and captain of the school, was about seventeen years of age.
He had won his supremacy, as all lads must do at schools, by hard fighting and expertness in outdoor games and sports, as much as by general proficiency in his studies.
The boys expected him, of course, to be dux in the schoolroom; they could never have respected a duffer, no matter how smart he may have been on the field.
An ignorant booby could never win schoolboy respect, no matter how great a fighter he proved himself to be.
To become the leader of a school requires many perfections in a boy.
He must have the same qualities which form a leader of men--personal force and self-control, the power of controlling and influencing those about him.
He must be always prepared and ready to face unexpected difficulties, be tireless in his work, willing ever to help his followers in their task, and thus win their admiration, by proving that he knows much more than they do.
He must be prepared to act as champion for the school, if called upon; to be the best batsman and bowler, the most tireless runner and swimmer; in fact, to be constantly on the qui vive.
Schoolboys are very keen critics, and don't give their admiration blindly.
True, once their allegiance is given, it takes a good deal to destroy the prestige of their hero.
Unlike grown men, they do not easily forget Ned Romer had all the natural qualities of a hero.
Physically, he was tall for his age, handsome, strongly formed, and absolutely fearless.
A well-posed, firm head rested between square shoulders.
His hair was crisp, curly, and light brown.
His eyes were those bright and blue eyes that look frankly and bravely out upon the world, and never shift when appealed to.
When boys or men possess those kind of eyes, a lie direct is an impossibility with them.
They cannot prevaricate.
It is not the despicable meanness of a lie that prevents them; they do not consider such ethics or reasons.
Like George Washington, they simply cannot tell a lie.
To do so would be a physical impossibility.
The liar and the craven are natural products, and go together, as real courage, magnanimity, and truth are ever found united.
His habits of constant exercise had made Ned Romer an athlete.
A natural aptitude for study and thirst for knowledge made his tasks a pleasure, and easy to acquire.
He was ambitious to shine, and could not endure defeat.
To him an obstacle meant an enemy to be overcome and destroyed, and until he achieved this, he had no peace of mind.
This was his last term at school; and during the years he had spent at Shebourne Academy, he had learnt that the most precious of all a brave man's possessions is the habit of controlling his temper.
He had a fiery temper.
Now, a temper is as needful to boy and man as a pair of strong arms, but, like strength, this must be kept in reserve for occasions when force is required, not dissipated in senseless outbursts.
As our story progresses, the reader will find out more about the characteristics and temper of Ned Romer.
Early in life he had been left an orphan, under the guardianship of his late father's solicitor.
This guardian was a bachelor, who evidently considered it to be the beginning and end of his duty to pay the school fees and other expenses of his ward.
In consequence of these arrangements, Shebourne Academy was the only home that Ned Romer had ever known, and his schoolfellows were his only friends.
Some lads would have felt lonely and have pined under the monotony of such a life; but Ned was not one of the brooding kind.
The country all round the academy was beautiful, being in the heart of Devonshire, and within sight of Dartmoor hills.
What money he required, in reason, his guardian freely sent, and as Ned had lived here ever since he could remember, his needs were not extravagant, with such Spartan tastes as he had.
Books he had in profusion, for the doctor's library was at his disposal.
He found amusement enough during the vacations in studying botany and reading books of travel and exploration.
When asked by his guardian what vocation he would like to take up in life, during one of that gentleman's rare visits, Ned had answered promptly--  "I mean to be a traveller."
His guardian was pleased with this reply; at least, he seemed to be so from the way his foxy face beamed and the manner in which he rubbed his hands together.
"Yes, Ned, I think such a life would suit a bold, strong lad like you exactly.
You might go to Australia or Africa, and make a fortune in no time."
"Oh, I don't care much about the fortune," replied Ned, carelessly.
"As long as I have enough to live and keep clear of debt, I'll be satisfied, so that I can do some good and help on civilisation and the glory and power of England."
"Like the great Cecil Rhodes, eh--the Empire maker?"
said his guardian, slyly.
"That is my ambition, Mr Raymond," answered Ned, calmly.
He was not very familiar with his guardian, and although he could not say that he disliked him, yet he always felt better pleased to bid him good-bye than to welcome him at the beginning of his infrequent and short visits.
"Hum--yes; I think we shall be able to advance your views in this respect.
Your father was not a rich man when he died, Edward.
However, I need not go into that matter now, as I shall tell you all about it when you have left school.
But I dare say--as I have been careful of what he did leave--that I shall be able to provide you with a comfortable start in life."
This conversation had taken place on the last visit of Mr Jabez Raymond to Shebourne Academy at the beginning of the finishing term.
Since then Ned had diligently pursued his studies, and was pretty well prepared to face the world, as far as theory could prepare a young man.
Experience must hereafter be the finisher of his education.
Clarence Raybold and Fred Weldon ranked next to Ned Romer in proficiency and expertness.
They were both bold fellows, who had moulded themselves, as far as they could, on the pattern of their leader and hero, Ned.
Both had battled and worked their way upwards to their present proud position.
The other boys owned their superiority, but--as will chance so often--while being good and faithful chums, there was not a little rivalry between them as to which should stand next to Ned Romer.
Some of the boys boasted that Raybold, the Africander, was the strongest and best; some vowed by Weldon, the Australian.
A school is somewhat like a ship; there cannot be two first officers any more than there can be two captains, if perfect harmony is to be maintained.
Affairs had been long brewing towards an open contest between these two friendly rivals for the supremacy.
They were very nearly the same age; Weldon was only a month older than Raybold, both being in their sixteenth year.
They were both tall and strong, Raybold an inch wider in the chest, while Weldon was two inches taller.
Raybold was the best batter, Weldon the best bowler.
They could both swim and dive like fish.
In this exercise they surpassed Ned and every other boy round about the countryside.
The favourite study of Ned was botany; Fred Weldon was an authority on chemistry, and Clarence Raybold on astronomy.
In these accomplishments they stood apart and equal.
In their other studies they were also reckoned pretty equal.
If one excelled in one branch, the other excelled in some other department.
There was only one way left to decide the question at issue, and this was, as Nature decides the same question of supremacy, by fighting.
It may seem a barbarous thing that boys and men cannot settle such disputed points in any other way except by battle.
Savages settle it thus.
Civilised races do the same, and amongst healthy boys it appears to be as strict a necessity as amongst men.
Thus it happened that a Saturday had been fixed upon for the grand tournament between those rival knights, with the entire school as spectators and Captain Edward Romer as umpire.
There was no personal bitterness between the two colonial boys, for although there had been of late considerable friction, this had occurred more between the supporters than the principals.
A mass meeting had been called, and the contest between Australia and Africa decided upon.
The two champions were moved alone by ambition and the desire to settle their future position, once and for all.
They had likewise agreed to abide by the decision of the umpire and the school, without any further appeal.
It was to be a friendly enough contest, yet all knew that it would not be a drawing-room or stage play.
It was to be a real, not a sham battle.
The ground fixed upon was about three miles from Shebourne, down by the river, at a spot where the banks were level and the water deep.
This was their usual bathing-place.
It is not my intention to describe this fight, further than to say that it was fought according to recognised rules, without prejudice, and decided in thirteen rounds.
The umpire watched keenly, and stopped each round when it was likely to become too fierce.
Thus, although some claret was spilt, it wasn't in serious quantities, and could easily be washed away without leaving any palpable traces.
Clarence Raybold came out of the "mill" with a swollen upper lip and some bruises on his biceps, and Fred Weldon with a flowing nose.
Raybold was declared victor, while Weldon accepted his defeat with a good grace.
Africa had beaten Australia by only two seconds of time, yet both had fought so splendidly that the audience, without exception, declared that the defeat was nearly as good as the victory.
Both had conducted themselves so temperately yet sturdily, taking and giving such real strokes, and warding off with such rare skill, that the supporters of Weldon were as proud of his actions as were the Raybold section of his deeds of daring.
With loud acclaim they were unanimously declared worthy champions of "Shebourne," of whom the academy ought to be proud.
It was a glorious day in early summer.
The leaves were lushly green and fresh, the sunbeams warm, and the water in front of them most inviting.
Therefore, after Ned had delivered his unalterable decision, young Africa shook hands with his brother young Australia, and they all finished up the fun by casting their clothes on to the grassy banks and plunging into the transparent river, like lively tadpoles.
After this eventful day there was complete concord at Shebourne Academy.
Fred Weldon took his orders from Clarence Raybold, who submitted to the wise and experienced authority of Ned Romer, and the long and happy days of schoolboy life flew on unheeded towards their close.
The hours which the three school leaders were spending in study and merry sport were bringing great events into their lives.
On the same day that Fred Weldon fought with Clarence Raybold by the side of that Devon river, his father, the reputed wealthy Australian, died a bankrupt, leaving his family almost paupers.
He had been involved in the disastrous land boom, and forced to mortgage all his stock and estates.
Indeed, for the past five or six years he had only been able to carry on his station through the leniency of his creditors.
When death overtook him, he had been threatened with foreclosure, which took place directly after his funeral.
It was a couple of weeks before the expiration of the last term for the three school friends, when a black-edged letter came to inform Fred about the death of his father and his own penniless condition.
A double blow that was, which prostrated the poor Australian boy, and took the sunshine out of his life.
He dearly loved his father, although he had not seen that father for the six years he had spent at Shebourne Academy.
To know that he should never again on earth see the kindly face of that loved parent nearly broke his tender heart.
He had been brought up under the belief that, as far as he was concerned, the seeking for a living was not a consideration which need occupy his attention.
He might go in for a profession as an amusement to fill out time, or study the wool markets in London, and afterwards take up his father's gentlemanly occupation as a squatter.
Money had never hitherto troubled his young mind.
A liberal allowance had been regularly paid to Dr Heardman for his use outside his school and clothing fees.
Up to this date he always had the most lavishly lined purse in the school.
Not being a cad, he never paraded his riches in the least.
He was free and open-handed, and ready always to give without considering or remembering; but with the instincts of generations of gentlemen in his blood, he gave or lent delicately, and without allowing his right hand to know what his left hand did.
He was in consequence universally liked and respected, instead of being hated, as ostentatious givers generally are.
A bluff, offhand manner covered a very warm and tender nature, as the brown freckles covered his clear skin, until the original tints had to be guessed at.
He had speckled, brown-grey eyes, a good deal resembling the colour of the iron stains so plentifully bespattered over his face.
This monotony of yellow-brown gave him a bark-like appearance that did not add to his beauty at first sight.
It was a good and a brave face, however, that of Fred Weldon, in spite of its dingy tones.
When he opened his mouth to laugh, he exhibited a fine set of strong white teeth that made him almost beautiful.
His laugh also was a ringing and a hearty laugh, which went straight into one's heart when heard.
By-and-by also, when one began to examine his points, it was wonderful how many excellences and beauties were disclosed.
Nicely shaped ears, although often skinned and roughened by the weather; well-shaped hands, although tanned by the sun; hair with a golden lustre and a sinuous waviness; delicately shaped lips; and a nose bold, fine, and straight, with nostrils sensitive as those of a well-bred horse.
Fred Weldon decidedly improved on acquaintance, for he was polite, considerate, and of a singularly happy disposition.
When the evil tidings came he showed his grit and breeding by at once facing the difficulty instead of bemoaning it idly.
He had no longer any expectations beyond what pocket-money he had saved, and fifty pounds which an uncle had sent him, to pay his fare, second class, out to Australia, if he cared to go.
This uncle told him kindly, but frankly, however, in his letter, that if he cared to go anywhere else for the present, it would be as well, for Australia could not hold out much-prospect for a penniless young man for some years yet to come.
His mother and sisters were provided for, as this uncle had taken them home to his station.
He need, therefore, suffer no anxiety on their account.
He had only himself now to consider.
It is a sad moment in the life of a boy when he loses his natural protector, even although he may step into his father's property.
This desolation becomes intensified when, besides his father, the boy loses home, and, with what makes home attractive, all certainty of the future.
Fred Weldon felt now, for the first time, that he was no longer a passenger in life's bark, but had been forced into the position of the formerly utterly trusted and lost pilot.
He had now to steer where formerly he had left that responsibility to others.
It would have been a most wretched time, those last two weeks at Shebourne Academy, for poor Fred Weldon, but for the kindly sympathy of both teachers and fellow-pupils.
These made him feel that misfortune has its compensations, when it brings out these traits of kindness and friendship.
The entire school united in showing to Fred how much he was cared for daring this period of grief and uncertainty.
But his two chums, Ned Romer and Clarence Raybold, did more, for they gripped the future with firm and energetic hands, and rendered it a definite plan.
As long as man or boy can map out his course with definite lines, he has something worth living for.
It is the groping through a damp and dark mistland after a formless ideal which rusts the mind and saps the vital forces.
As long as we can trace a path, so we can follow it; as long as we know our direction, difficulties are almost pleasures.
Without his two chums, Fred might have fallen into an inert condition and given way to despair.
Without this sudden calamity befalling him, those three friends might have parted on that vacation and gone different ways, to idle and dream abortive things.
Now it knitted their lives together, and while they discussed his affairs, they settled their own.
Fred had received his letter on a Friday.
On Saturday afternoon the three friends were lying on the banks of the river near the bathing-pool.
Fred was in the centre, lying on his back and looking at the sky.
His friends reclined on each side of him, resting on their elbows, and plucking daisies and buttercups aimlessly.
That was their way of exhibiting their sympathy.
They would not look at him, for they instinctively felt that he would resent being watched just now.
He could not help his eyes filling now and then, as he saw pictures of his lost Australian home with his father in that upper patch of dark blue sky, but he would have hated his chums to see him crying like a girl.
So also would they have despised and detested themselves for watching these signs of weakness.
To cry is human, and sometimes cannot be kept under--a man will own this with shame; but it is abominable to be seen at the pitiful game, and no real friend would ever own he had seen his chum at it.
This is one of the sacred obligations of man-friendship.
"I say, Raybold," cried Ned, speaking over the silent Fred, "I've been thinking lately of making my exploration ground Africa.
Do you intend sticking to Johannesburg when you leave here?"
"Not likely, Ned; the pater wishes me to move about and see the country before I settle down."
"Well, what do you say to making a company affair of it?"
continued Ned, cheerfully.
"England, Australia, and Africa against the world."
"I am agreeable," replied Clarence.
"What do you say, Fred, to this partnership?"
"What partnership?"
asked Fred, waking from his melancholy reverie.
"That we should go to Africa and become bona fide explorers.
The company to be called the Clarfredned Company of explorers and gentlemen adventurers."
"With the last first, of course, Ned," added Clarence, modestly.
"Well, yes; I suppose I do know a trifle more than you pair of scientists, having a year's advantage of you.
And I haven't the slightest objection to be your chief, on one condition."
"And that?"
"My condition is, that I provide the first expenses."
"Again agreeable," replied Clarence Raybold, with alacrity.
"My pater, since the Jameson Raid, hasn't had too much cash to spare.
What with confiscation, fines, and taxes, the life of an Uitlander is not an enviable one in the Transvaal.
Therefore I willingly accept your terms, and declare you to be my captain."
"What do you say, Weldon?"
asked Ned, calmly looking at the water pool.
He did this because there were indications of a girlish breakdown on the part of Fred.
His eyelids were twitching, and he was gulping something down that appeared to be choking him.
"Some fellows go and pay a lot of money to be allowed to join an expedition of this sort.
I regard these fellows as fools to pay for what should be paid for.
The leader always gets the kudos, therefore he ought to pay the costs.
Now, boys, I'm fond of kudos, and I mean to have as much of it as I can out of this affair, therefore I reckon it is only fair that I should pay the piper."
Ned spoke musingly, and flicked with his stick at some grass-stalks.
Then Clarence Raybold took up the cue with the instinctive feelings of a gentleman.
"Those are my sentiments also, of course, when partners go for equal shares in profits as well as adventures.
I think, as a kind of guarantee of good faith, the subordinates ought to give a little.
Now, I would pledge myself to the extent of twenty pounds, and leave my leader to do all the rest.
What do you say, Weldon, old fellow, to contributing twenty pounds each, and letting Ned do the rest?"
Fred crushed back into his eyelids a couple of tears, and then, gulping down a big sob, like a huge pill, with the indifference of a Stoic, he said--  "I'd give fifty pounds willingly to go with you and Ned; but if you decide on twenty as the sum, all right, only I have an amendment to propose."
"What is that?"
asked both Ned and Clar, suspiciously.
"If we should discover any diamond or gold mines, or other treasures, that the expenses be then fairly divided, and deducted from our shares of profits."
cried Ned and Clar, in one breath.
Then the lads shook hands solemnly, and the compact was made, which gave them a grand object in life, and sent them forth in search of the adventures which are now to be related.
The next two weeks were spent in maturing plans by the young men for their intended expedition.
Maps were consulted, and books of travel-- Livingstone, Stanley, and other authorities--devoured in such leisure times as they had from their finishing studies.
At last the day arrived--their last day of school life; their last day under the fatherly control of Dr Heardman.
The good doctor was proud of his three crack pupils, and prophesied great futures for them.
The younger schoolmates went off to their different homes in deep dejection, wondering how they were ever to get on, the next term, without their heroes and champions.
Of course their places would quickly be filled up, for heroic souls and talented minds are common enough products of British soil.
Infatuated adherents of Disraeli, Gladstone, and Salisbury are apt to fancy that chaos must come when they have gone from their posts.
Yet the old state coach rumbles along pretty much as it did in the days of former drivers.
The ocean nibbles away at sea-coasts, and encroaches every year in some parts, while it retires from others in the same proportions.
Continents have been submerged, and ancient cities buried under the brine; but other continents, cities, and nations have risen and taken the work of civilisation upon them.
The earth has not become a fraction smaller, the ocean has not increased by so much as a drop of water.
Heroes have risen and carved their names on the monument of history, but mankind has not suffered by their passing away.
It benefited, perchance, through their living, as the grain-fields benefit by the passing rains; yet as the moisture returns to the clouds, and comes down again and again, so do great deeds repeat themselves amongst men as in nature.
The drop of rain is nothing after it has done its work; the man is of no more consideration after the emergency has passed for which his strength was produced.
For a time the renown of those three champions would hover over Shebourne Academy.
The acts of the new claimants would be criticised and compared with what had been done before by those doughty heroes.
Then the hour would arrive when their successors appeared to overtop them in the eyes of the young censors; then they would fade into oblivion with the majority, and be remembered by a few as demi-gods.
In every school there are minds formed to lead and natures made to admire.
Wisely, the majority of mankind are those who exist for the present, and trouble themselves neither with the past nor the future.
Their hero is the one who serves their interests for the time.
Thus mankind goes on, trampling the road smoother which old footsteps have partly made, leaving the dreamers and the regretters to linger on the side pathways.
Filled with hope and laden with their prizes, the three boys bade farewell to their old life, and set forth to interview the present arbitrator of their lives, Mr Jabez Raymond--the man who held the sinews of war.
Ned had written to this gentleman, and in his reply Mr Raymond gave them a warm invitation to visit him and consult over matters at his place.
Mr Jabez Raymond was, as we have already stated, not a family man, but he had a good practice in the cathedral town of Abbotsmore, about one hundred and thirty miles from Shebourne.
His sister acted as housekeeper to him, and although it was not a very large house, yet Ned Romer wondered that he had not been invited before during his holidays.
There were bedrooms enough to accommodate him and his comrades.
He excused his guardian, however, as being a bachelor, and not caring for the company of youngsters.
Mr Raymond's house and offices faced the main street, with the cathedral in front of it, and a large garden leading down to the river at the back.
It was an old-fashioned and somewhat dark house inside, filled with passages, recesses, cupboards, and unexpected nooks.
The walls of the dining-room were oak-wainscotted.
The offices also were lined with the same enduring and time-blackened material.
It had been a great family house at one time, as the crests and ornaments on the ceilings showed.
The small-paned windows likewise told of its ancient history.
The furniture also was old and solid, with little of the modern superfluities to lighten it up.
It was a comfortable house, but not one where youth would be likely to bud out with exuberance.
Both Mr Raymond and his austere sister suited the appointments of the house.
She was an elderly spinster, stiff, precise, and most severely orderly.
He was a sharp-faced man, who appeared wedded to his legal documents, and possessing a mind never far out of his office.
It was late in the afternoon when our heroes arrived, and, after spending a few hours in the society of their host and hostess, they were not sorry when bedtime came.
"There is no good lingering here any longer than we can help, lads," said Ned on retiring.
"Tomorrow I intend to tackle old Raymond, and see what he purposes doing for us."
That night the lawyer had a final look over the papers relating to the affairs of his late client, Mr Romer.
He did this after the boys and his household had retired and behind locked doors.
A fox-like man of about fifty Mr Jabez was, with thin hair and side whiskers, originally dark red, but now grizzled and grey.
Much poring over documents had reddened his eyelids and sharp long nose, and taken the red out of his long parchment-like jaws.
His mouth was thin-lipped and wide, which gave him an unpleasant grin when he smiled, as he was doing now, his eyes also were yellow speckled, like Fred Weldon's, but, unlike Fred's open eyes, they were shifty and half hidden by the reddened, scantily lashed lids.
"Hum, these will do, I think.
It is not at all likely that this boy will dispute my accounts or ask outside aid to understand these professional mysteries.
I'll have it over tomorrow with him, while he is eager to get away, and make him a liberal offer, to be rid of him at once and for ever."
It will be seen from this muttered soliloquy inside the door of Mr Jabez Raymond's study that he was of the same mind as his unsophisticated ward--to get into and over business as rapidly as possible.
Next morning, therefore, after the customary breakfast of bacon and eggs, he forestalled Ned by asking the three boys into his sanctum.
"I intended to postpone going into particulars respecting your late father's affairs until you had gained your majority, Mr Edward; but as you have already mapped out your career, I think it will meet your views if I do so at once."
He grinned, what he considered to be an indulgent smile upon the young gentlemen, while instinctively they wished he had not done so; that widening of his thin mouth somehow spoilt the effect of his words.
"I do not suppose you have any desire to go very deeply into your family history.
Yet you had best glance over these documents after I have told you briefly their contents, and see how at present your fortune stands."
"Your word will be quite sufficient, Mr Raymond," replied Ned, hastily.
"My father trusted you, and that is quite enough for me."
The lawyer once more grinned, and spread out his hands in a deprecating fashion, as he answered--  "You must not do this, my young friend, with every one you meet, or you may live to regret it.
Your poor, noble, and generous-hearted father trusted too many people for his own welfare and those coming after him, otherwise I should have had more satisfactory accounts to give you."
"Yet if others deceived him, I am sure you could not, Mr Raymond."
"Thank you, Edward.
I may say that I have tried my utmost to prove a just and faithful steward, but alas!
I found matters in a sad muddle, which have taken me all your years to disentangle; even now the unpleasant task is far from being done.
Listen, and I'll try to give you a summary of how you stand."
Clarence and Fred were moving off towards the window, thinking that they had no right to listen to these private disclosures, when Mr Jabez stopped them.
"Please sit down and listen also, young gentlemen.
Four heads are better than two, even although one happens to be that of a lawyer, in a business of this kind.
Besides, we may require you as witnesses."
The two bowed and returned to their chairs.
"When your father inherited the Romer estates, Edward, he was, as you are, an only child, and, like you, had been left early an orphan.
"My predecessors, Messrs. Skinner and Bland, had been the family solicitors of your grandfather, and although the property was a wide-spreading one, with many prosperous farms upon it, yet it had been considerably mortgaged for the two past generations.
"Ostensibly your father's income was eight thousand, but really, at the date of his succession, six thousand five hundred of this went yearly to pay the interest of the old mortgages.
"This was bad enough, yet it might have been improved with care, economy, and a wealthy marriage.
Your dear, chivalrous father, however, did not come from a cheese-paring race, and he was too noble to sell himself for money."
"Dear father," murmured Ned.
He was too young at that father's death to remember what he was like, but this testimony to his generous and disinterested nature touched a kindred chord in the boy's heart.
continued the lawyer, softly.
"You were too young to remember what your father was like, yet in outward appearance you resemble him, and doubtless you have the same fine and gentlemanly disregard for money.
It runs in the blood."
As Ned did not reply, Mr Jabez went on--  "Some, as I have said, might have tried by marriage or strict economy to better their condition.
But Mr Romer did neither.
He married the lady of his choice, who had nothing; then, after marriage, he kept up the old style at Romer Court.
"After a few years his income had dwindled down to nine hundred, and then he tried, by speculating, to regain what he had lost.
His speculations were not lucky ones.
The friends he trusted failed him at the finish, so that when he died, twelve months after your mother, he was responsible for more than the small income left him, and had only mortgaged property to leave behind, a large number of personal debts, and nothing else to leave."
"Then where did the money come from to keep me all these years at school, Mr Raymond?"
Asked Ned, quickly.
The lawyer flushed a brickly flush as he answered--"Well, I am coming to that subject, my dear young friend.
When I undertook your father's affairs, I went to work energetically and justly, yet without sentiment--lawyers do not work often in that vein.
I mastered the debts of honour and the extent of the mortgages, and managed to scrape sufficient to pay for your education."
"Then there is nothing left for me?"
Asked Ned, blankly.
"Softly, softly, my dear boy.
I have almost settled all the personal debts, and am now working to reduce the mortgages."
But how about the present?
Can I not realise any money?"
"I have made some arrangements with my own bank, and can let you have a lump sum of say five hundred pounds on your note of hand, only if I do this it will mean drawing your income until you are of age."
"I am quite willing to sign any document you like if you can do this without inconveniencing yourself, Mr Romer," said Ned, eagerly.
Mr Jabez Raymond gazed upon his ward for a few moments silently, while he appeared to think.
Then he spoke.
"It is not exactly professional; but as you wish to try your fortune in Africa, while from all reports, Africa is the coming land for fortune-making, I think it can be done.
I wish you first to read over carefully these documents, in which all I have told you is written, and also examine carefully this parchment, which I have drawn up for you to sign--examine them and consult together about them.
When you have done this, if you decide to have the money down now, instead of drawing it quarterly for the next four years, you can let me know on my return at lunch-time."
Mr Jabez rose as he said these words, and leaving the boys to study the pile of parchment, he went out to attend to his other business.
They had been accustomed to difficult problems at Dr Heardman's Academy, but those were simple to solve compared to the understanding of these legally obscured documents.
After a long hour of bewilderment, Ned laid them down respectfully in a heap, and turned dolefully upon his trusty but equally befogged comrades.
"Well, boys, what do you make out of these mysteries?"
"Nothing, except a dry throat and an aching head," replied Clarence Raybold.
"Let's go for a walk, and get some gooseberries.
I'm not going to attempt the impossible," cried Ned, decidedly.
This proposal was grateful to the others, so together they went out to the sun, and enjoyed themselves till lunch-time.
After lunch the lawyer read over the document which required the signature of Ned.
It sounded all right, although terribly garnished with obscure phrases.
There were blank spaces to be afterwards filled up, such as the amounts received, with the terms of repayment, dates, and conditions, which Mr Jabez explained as he read in his most fatherly tones.
It sounded all right, therefore Ned put his name boldly at the bottom in the presence of Miss Priscilla Raymond and his two friends, who afterwards signed theirs as witnesses.
This document dried, and locked with other papers into Mr Raymond's safe, the lawyer drew a cheque in his own name and went to the bank to get it cashed.
Five hundred pounds seemed a big fortune to the three young adventurers, who had hitherto been more than passing wealthy on an odd half-sovereign.
It was a vast sum to think about, and its possibilities seemed limitless.
They felt likewise, as they talked over matters, that appearances were unjustly against Mr Jabez Raymond, and how his face and manners belied his real nature.
If he had the face of a fox, and that peculiarly slinking manner generally ascribed to false natures and treacherous dogs, his present actions all went to prove that he was entirely the opposite to what these outward signs betokened.
Ned remembered how the ancient physiognomist had misread the great Socrates; and how the good philosopher confirmed his opinion, by telling his disciples that he might have been the degraded being the physiognomist said he was, but for his power of self-restraint.
Perhaps Mr Jabez Raymond had the gift of Socrates, and had mastered his original tendencies.
If, therefore, he looked and grinned like a wily fox, while he listened to their plans, and heard them joy over their store of cash, he certainly showed that he had full faith in their discretion by placing this large sum so freely at their disposal.
He also exhibited the active side of his appreciation and sympathy by aiding them in every way that he could.
Indeed, older heads than theirs might have been a little surprised at the extraordinary zeal he showed in advancing them on their journey.
He devoted himself so entirely to the lads during their short stay at his house, that more experienced people might have grown suspicious.
But to the young fellows, this exclusive attention, which prevented them from talking with any one outside the lawyer's household--this eager zeal that made him accompany them to London and attend to their comfort while there, were so many signs that he was their best friend and well-wisher.
Their first unpleasant impressions faded quickly away, and they even forgot to shiver before that long and crafty grin.
Why should any man be distrusted because at times he may remind one of a beast of some kind, when his acts are those of a benefactor?
It is by their actions people prove themselves, not by their looks.
Mr Jabez Raymond took one of his rare holidays from business and accompanied them to London.
He took them to a staid and respectable inn in Holborn, and went with them to the best theatres, music-halls, and picture-galleries during the week.
On Sunday he took them to hear two of the most celebrated preachers.
During the day he accompanied them to the shops where outfits were to be had, and insisted on getting for them the best that could be purchased, paying for everything himself without a murmur.
They had considered him to be a hard man at first sight, but now they were forced to alter their opinions when they witnessed his generosity.
He introduced them to the Dutch agent of a big South African firm at the Cape, who was called Johannes Groblaar, and who not only gave them much sage advice, but told them that his nephew was going out in the next steamship, and would accompany them if they liked.
This friendly offer they gladly accepted, as Stephanus Groblaar was a native of Pretoria, and knew the country thoroughly.
Thus they found everything made easy for them at the start by this benevolent and generous guardian, and after a pleasant sojourn of eight days in London, they bade farewell to Mr Raymond at the East India Docks, and prepared to enjoy three weeks' sea-voyage as saloon passengers.
Everything they could think about, even their passage-money, had been paid from the purse of Mr Raymond, in spite of their protests, and they were carrying their store of funds untouched.
By this time their hearts were completely won, and they vowed that old Raymond was a jolly fine fellow.
This jolly fine fellow stood on the deck until the bell rang for the tender to return.
He rubbed his lean hands together when not engaged spreading one hand over his wide mouth to cover a yawn.
Then, with a hearty handshake, he returned to the train, while the steamship proceeded on her voyage.
To amuse himself on the journey back, he took out his pocket-book and added up the expenses he had been put to for the young gentlemen.
The grin had left his jaws at the last wave of his handkerchief.
He now looked grim, yet on the whole not dissatisfied.
"Priscilla will grumble at the large outlay," he muttered; "but it was necessary to keep the young cub in a proper mood, and leave a good impression.
Now he can have no suspicions, and I have four years to turn myself about, even if he ever comes back to claim his own, which is extremely doubtful."
Ned Romer was going away full of faith and loving-kindness towards this knave who had been robbing him systematically for years.
What he had given had not been a quarter's interest on the money due to Ned, therefore no wonder that he felt it needful to expend this sum-- particularly with that document in his possession.
The trusting father had left him entire control of the estate, with the possession of all papers and deeds; thus he had not many fears about his peculations being discovered.
The parchment which Ned had signed was really a deed of sale of all that he had inherited from his father.
Being a minor, it was as yet useless in a legal sense, but as the dates were not yet added, Mr Raymond was prepared to advance these dates by four years, if what he expected happened.
If Ned added his bones to the number of those who had left them in the wilds of that fatal country, this could easily be done without any dispute.
Indeed, Mr Jabez would hardly require any deed to step into the property which he had already marked out as his own.
Yet possible heirs might turn up unexpectedly, and it would quash their claims.
If Ned returned, more wide-awake than he had left, the wily lawyer had all these years to prepare for him.
"I don't think this cub will come back, and it is not likely that he will make name enough for his death to be much noticed."
Mr Jabez Raymond belonged to the singular sect of Bedlitonians, and amongst them he was a shining light as a local preacher.
The thought of what he had done, and what he planned, did not disturb his conscience in the least.
He possessed the not uncommon quality of being able to separate business entirely from religion; therefore the following Sunday evening he preached a very edifying sermon to his brethren, and went home to sister Priscilla as full of rectitude and self-righteousness as any local preacher could be.
Humanity is crammed with such anomalies.
Stephanus Groblaar, the new companion and shipmate of our heroes, was a pleasant and affable young Boer of about twenty-two.
As a specimen of his countrymen, he impressed them most favourably.
He was straw-haired and grey-eyed, with skin suntanned to a warm amber tint.
Tall, burly, yet well formed, he was a picture of rude strength and solid resolution.
In repose, his heavy features gave him rather a morose appearance, however.
But he could be very frank and engaging when he liked, and as he set himself to win the friendship of the young men, it was not long before he did so.
They passed a very pleasant time going to the Cape, and the river and coast scenery made them decide to keep diaries.
These diaries began all right with a description of the river Thames and coast as far as Southampton, but long before they reached Madeira the diaries were laid aside, and never again taken up.
Jotting down ordinary events did not appeal to our three heroes.
They resolved to give their pens a rest until they had killed their first real wild beast.
Stephanus Groblaar spoke to them sensibly and sagely.
While they listened to his prudent advice, they felt they could not do better than act upon it.
"You will find that five or six hundred pounds will not go far in Africa.
It will be best to bank it, and try to make your way without breaking upon your capital, or rather work for money to add to it."
"What do you think we should do?"
enquired Ned.
"Anything that turns up.
I may get you a bullock team to help to drive up to the Transvaal.
That would show you a lot of the country, and give you plenty of experience as well.
It is rough a bit, and will take you some time, but you don't mind that, I suppose?"
"Not at all; it will train us to rough it in the wilds, and we can afford to spend a little time getting colonial experience."
This conversation took place between Madeira and the island of Tenerife.
A curious, and what might have been a tragic adventure had happened to Ned Romer just outside of Funchal, while they were seeing the sights of that lovely and precipitous island of Madeira.
The three young men had gone inland with Stephanus Groblaar.
While standing on the edge of one of the cliffs with a sheer drop of seven hundred feet, Stephanus had suddenly made a stumble and lurched against Ned with his full force.
The guide, who was near at hand, saved our principal hero from a horrible death, by what seemed like a miracle.
Ned was just going over, when the guide caught hold of his coat-tails, and by a sudden and powerful tug, landed him on his back over the body of Stephanus, who had fallen on his face.
It was a considerable shock to Ned's nerves, and he rose a little chalky about the gills.
But his pallor was nothing to that which overspread the face of the young Boer, making his bronzed skin look like old ivory.
He shook as if he had the palsy, and for some moments could not utter a word.
When he did find his voice, his expressions of regret and self-reproach were painful to listen to, considering that it was only an accident.
He said he had been seized with a sudden giddiness which he could not account for.
The guide listened to his explanation and apologies with a stolid expression, but took good care during the rest of the journey to keep a firm hold of his arm when they were near any dangerous ledge.
It was while they were lying at Tenerife that the second attack of giddiness seized Stephanus, and once more Ned was the object against which he fell.
A portion of the ship's rail had been removed, and Ned was standing by the open gap, looking over the moonlit sea.
It was a lovely night and hot.
Ned had come on deck in his pyjamas to have a cool down before turning in for the night.
The deck at this part was quite deserted, as it was past midnight.
Clarence and Fred had walked over to the engine-room, and Ned fancied that he was quite alone at that moment.
Suddenly he felt a violent push from behind, and next instant he was in the sea with a splash.
When he rose to the surface and cleared the water from his eyes, he found a rope within reach, and very quickly clambered on board, nothing the worse for his unexpected bath.
In a few more moments, Stephanus Groblaar with Clarence and Fred were also pulled up safely from the shark-infested waves.
The two friends had seen the accident which caused Ned and Stephanus to tumble overboard, and without a pause they had sprung in also.
It was lucky for the Boer that they did this, also that they were such expert swimmers, as it appeared he could not swim a stroke.
Indeed, he was almost drowned before they could get hold of him.
It had happened as before, through his unfortunate giddiness; this time Ned had instinctively made a clutch at him and pulled him over, otherwise he might only have fallen to the deck.
When Stephanus recovered his senses, he enquired anxiously who had saved his life, and, when told that it was Clarence and Fred, he expressed his gratitude in a few heartfelt words, and vowed that he would never forget this great service.
He also said how sorry he was to have imperilled the life of Ned, and hoped he would forgive him.
Ned treated the matter as a first-class joke, but told Stephanus that he should avoid open spaces near the sea, since he could not swim, and mountain ledges, since he could not fly.
"For myself, I am as much at home in the water as on dry land; so also are my chums.
It was much more dangerous, however, at Madeira."
"I trust this may be my last attack of giddiness," answered Stephanus, huskily.
"It is the extra fine living on board ship which must have made me bilious, I think."
"Funny, isn't it, that you should have been seized twice when near me?"
remarked Ned, unsuspiciously.
The young Boer shot a rapid and furtive glance at Ned, but seeing how open he looked, he smiled and held out his hand.
"It was lucky for me both times that you were in front of me, if not so for you.
In a sense you have also saved my life, Edward Romer."
"Not at all; only you ought to learn to swim."
"And fly," added Fred, who was standing beside them.
For the rest of the voyage Stephanus had no more giddy attacks, and his young friends quickly forgot the accidents.
The Boer, however, did not forget his obligations.
He was more profuse in his expressions towards Ned; yet if quieter towards the others, he attached himself more to them, and showed by many signs that he liked them better than he appeared to like Ned.
Thus the days passed pleasantly until they dropped anchor at Cape Town, and went ashore to begin their new life.
The first week at Cape Town shook them up more than years of living in England could have done.
They had been only boys when they first sighted Table Mountain, but in a week's time they felt and acted like men.
"It is a queer place, this Cape Town," observed Ned, as they walked through the streets, and looked about them.
It was queer because it was all so strange and new to these English-bred lads.
The sandstorm that greeted them on their landing did not surprise the two colonial boys as it did Ned Romer.
They endured the infliction philosophically, while Ned groaned, and wished for a few moments that he had stopped in dear old England.
But this gust passed, and, being the first of his experience, it seemed the worst.
In a short time he became accustomed to sand, shortness of water, and the lack of a host of conveniences which had appeared as necessities to him at one time.
Stephanus Groblaar continued his protection and friendship to them all the time they were at Cape Town and its surrounding districts.
He took them to his uncle's house, and so saved them the expense of living at any of the hotels, which was a great saving to them.
The South Africans are a hospitable people, and the town-educated Dutch very different from their country cousins, the Transvaal Boers.
The lads were delighted with their reception and generous treatment.
They explored Table Mountain, and passed several happy days before they had exhausted the sights of this ancient African capital.
The uncle of Stephanus was the owner of a large and prosperous vineyard in Stellenbosch, and he had half a dozen fair, plump, and lively female cousins, ranging from seven years of age to twenty-three.
Stephanus was engaged to the second oldest, a girl of nineteen.
They had also eight brothers, all living at home and assisting in the different departments of the wine business.
It was, therefore, a large household, and when the day's work was over, a merry, home-like party in the evenings.
It seemed to the lads as if they were transported back a couple of centuries while they rested in this vine farm.
The buildings were nearly the same age as the great oak trees that surrounded them and shaded the roadways.
The tiles and bricks with which they were built had been made in and brought from Holland.
Everything was quaint, old-fashioned, and picturesque.
The master of the house was patriarchal with his family and servants, and the mother was a real mistress after the good old style.
Morning and evening the old Bible was brought out, and every one was forced to join in the religious exercise.
The master did not greatly believe in his coloured servants having souls, yet as this had come to be a disputed question amongst some of the advanced Boers, Van Groblaar gave them the benefit of the doubt, and made them also attend family worship.
He was a strict and severe master with these dark-skinned bondmen and bondwomen, yet his patriarchal system appeared to be the right one as far as they were concerned.
On this farm they did their work much better than they would have done under the English system.
The girls had been educated at the best Cape schools.
They could play on the piano, and had all the other accomplishments of young ladies.
Yet this did not make them disdain household and farm work.
They were all able to milk the cows, make butter and cheese, and do all the other duties expected from a Dutch housewife.
They reserved their fancy accomplishments for the evenings, and were up to their daily work long before the sun rose.
Although it was a remarkably enjoyable life which the boys led at Stellenbosch, they quickly wearied of it, and began to long for something more exciting.
The riding lessons which they took with the sons, and the gun practice were all very useful, yet humiliating also, since they could never hope to compete with those born marksmen and centaurs.
It is almost impossible for a true Africander to miss his mark or be unseated from his horse.
As soon, therefore, as they had learnt something about the managing of cattle and Kaffirs, and had found their way about the country, they began to find the society of their puritanical burgher friends slightly irksome.
The charming scenery became monotonous, and the tinkle of a piano almost as hard to endure as a barrel-organ is to some ears.
The desire to trek had come upon them, and whenever men or boys get that desire, no fertile oasis, no earthly paradise, can hold them back from the desert.
Stephanus, who was in their confidence, had a private conversation with his uncle Groblaar, and communicated the result one morning to them as they were moping amongst the ripening grapes.
It was not easy for the young ladies or the stolid sons of Van Groblaar to understand how any human being could be melancholy as long as there was plenty to eat and drink.
In their own placid minds three of the daughters had decided that Ned, Fred, and Clarence had the makings of very good farmers and husbands in them, and for this felt gratified to Cousin Stephanus for bringing them.
They were considerably startled, therefore, and not a little distressed, when they saw how our heroes brightened up after they heard the result of that family confab.
The old Dutchman, who took a long time to decide upon anything, had been persuaded to send up his yearly consignment of wines and brandy to Johannesburg without any further delay.
It would go by road as usual, and the new comrades were to go with the waggons.
By doing this they would see the country, while the journey would not cost them anything.
This offer was gladly accepted by the young men--for they were now, in their own and the estimation of the young ladies, such.
They no longer wondered how time was to be killed, but eagerly began to prepare for the long and slow overland journey.
The Groblaar wines and brandy were greatly prized, and fetched big prices everywhere in the market.
In the Transvaal particularly they were vastly appreciated.
The age was to be depended upon, and the quality; while the grower considered that the contents of these matured hogsheads would be ruined if transported by any other mode than oxen.
Another reason they had for going by road instead of rail.
There were numerous customers to be served en route, at places outside the line of the railway.
Three of the eldest sons were deputed to go on this trek along with our heroes and Cousin Stephanus, and as they looked upon this journey as their annual holiday, they provided themselves with everything needful to enjoy themselves.
Twenty teams were required to carry the stores, provisions, and merchandise.
The oxen were all specially selected, and the waggons and drays reliable as well as strong; so that when they mounted their horses and inspanned, they were a very smart and prosperous-looking caravan.
Our heroes made their farewells joyously, for they were heart-whole.
They did not notice the sad looks that followed after them.
Yet three of Van Groblaar's young daughters did not display their customary appetite at dinner that day, nor did they seem much inclined for supper either that night.
Next day, however, they all made up for their unusual fast.
Ned was a little surprised when he came to say good-bye to the young lady who had given him most of her company during his stay, by her saying to him, in a slightly tremulous voice--  "You are going out to a strange land, where there are many dangers.
Take care!"
"Oh, I'll look out for number one, you bet, Miss Santa."
"Take care of the wild-beast traps."
"Oh yes, I know; open gaps, and that sort of thing."
"Yes; and"--she flushed scarlet while she whispered softly--"and look out also for Cousin Stephanus; he does not like you."
She turned from him swiftly as she gave this warning, and ran indoors, while he mounted his horse, wondering what she could mean.
Then, as he rode slowly on, he recalled the accidents on the outward voyage, with other signs which might have escaped his notice but for this last whisper from the young Dutch maiden.
He was not quite so guileless as he had been a few months before.
Whatever the reasons were, he felt himself forced to the conclusion that Stephanus Groblaar did not care greatly for him, although he seemed attached to his two chums.
Stephanus avoided him as much as possible while they had been on the farm, and he had caught sundry sullen and furtive glances which looked almost like hatred at times.
Well, forewarned is forearmed to some extent.
Ned shook the momentary uneasiness and depression from his heart, and soon was riding along merrily with the others.
Not being a fool, however, he resolved to keep a wary eye on this supposed evil-wisher, and look out for any more awkward fits.
It is nasty for any one to feel that he is disliked, much more so if he has done nothing to incur that disagreeable sentiment.
Ned Romer was guiltless of anything as far as he knew.
He was the most generous and happy of the party.
As yet he had never entertained a single animosity towards a human being.
Everything that he saw entertained him and provided him with amusement.
He had no fear, and tried to make friends with every one.
Besides, he felt specially obliged, in many ways, to Stephanus Groblaar, and therefore would have sacrificed a good deal to be his friend.
But a new instinct had been roused in his nature by those parting words of Santa.
The first seeds of suspicion were sown in that generous soil.
This seed would grow until it destroyed the unwise trust of boyhood, and make of him a vigilant and discriminating man in the future.
Truly he had left adolescence behind him when his horse walked under the shady oak avenues of Stellenbosch.
Nothing occurred, however, to mar their harmony as they moved slowly upward through the populated portions of Cape Colony.
Day after day went along with varying incidents and amusements.
When they were able they spent the night at some friendly settler's homestead, and were most hospitably welcomed and entertained.
These were, without exception, Dutch farmers, and old friends of the Groblaars, so that they saw little enough of the British members of the community.
They had mastered enough of the Cape Dutch and "Kitchen Kaffir" idioms to understand what was said, as well as express themselves to be understood by those they were so constantly thrown amongst by this time.
As every one was alike free and kind, if a bit rough and homely, they took the most favourable impression possible of this industrious if slow-going and bigoted race.
It was not nice to hear Englishmen so constantly spoken about with such contempt as a nation of cowards and oppressors; yet as the Boers gave their opinions good-naturedly, and exhibited such an utter want of knowledge in their statements, the lads could not help laughing also as they listened.
The farther up they travelled the more crassly ignorant and prejudiced they found their hosts to be; yet, although they universally insulted and tried to bespatter the Union Jack, they universally made their English guests as heartily welcome as were their Dutch friends.
The rites of hospitality were most generously observed.
It was not that these Dutch Africanders were all uncouth and ignorant men and women.
The majority of them were as well and even more highly educated than are these classes in England.
A large proportion of them had likewise travelled and seen England and the Continent.
It seemed the fashion to be prejudiced against England.
They had taken their preconceived notions along with them wherever they went, accepting only such evidences and historical facts as suited their own side of the disputed question.
"The English are a nation of liars, and don't know much about anything useful.
They are no use anywhere, and they are almost done for."
This was the universal opinion of the Dutch natives of Africa, and no argument could move them one iota.
They all spoke banteringly and with good-tempered irony, as one might speak of something settled and past curing or dispute.
They despised the English as a nation, abhorred Cecil Rhodes, and laughed at Gladstone as a friendly old imbecile.
But they did not object to individuals.
The boys listened and laughed with their bigoted but generous friends, and took all this talk in the same good part.
There were many incidents on this overland journey, both humorous and adventurous, which might have formed subjects for future talk.
But the after events dwarfed these minor adventures so completely that they were hardly ever mentioned.
Small game was plentiful on some of the open parts, and afforded them good enough sport after a tame fashion.
Here the Dutchmen displayed their wonderful skill as marksmen, and won unqualified admiration and respect.
When they saw the unfailing and deadly precision of that shooting, and how little lead was wasted, the lads no longer felt any surprise at the surrender of Dr Jameson at Krugersdorp.
Surrounded as he had been by such sharpshooters, he had not a chance of holding out, almost shelterless as he was.
The Dutchmen were all mightily proud of the achievements of their friends in the Transvaal, and not at all delicate in their boasting.
They were never tired of hearing and speaking about "Bronkhurst Spruit," "Laing's Nek," and "Majuba Hill," as well as this latest defeat at Krugersdorp.
As for Johannesburg and its craven citizens, long before the lads saw this golden city of the veldt, its degradation had been forced deep into their hearts by this contemptuous banter.
Stephanus Groblaar altered his manner in a most marked degree as they progressed up the country.
On the voyage out and at Cape Town he had seemed one of the most advanced and liberal-minded of young Boers.
He even appeared to take the part of the Uitlanders then, and thus had won their respect and confidence.
But now he became the loudest and most insulting of the despisers and denouncers of everything British.
He lost the small amount of humour that he seemed to have possessed, and which his franker cousins still retained, and grew savage instead of bantering in his expressions.
He was returning home to Pretoria, after two years of social intercourse with Englishmen, as full of race hatred as any of his untravelled countrymen.
Clarence Raybold saw this new phase with silent surprise, and listened to his exasperating observations with tightly closed mouth and lowering eyes.
At last one night matters were brought to a crisis.
They had crossed the Vaal river, and were outspanning on the open veldt.
Eight of their heavy-laden teams were all that remained with them.
The contents of the other twelve drays had been disposed of on the way up, and the teams sent down the country again with chance loads.
The eldest of Santa's brothers alone remained with the young men and Stephanus to look after the Transvaal business.
He was a stolid, good-natured fellow, who did his utmost to keep peace in the camp, and turn his cousin's ill-timed remarks into jokes.
But Stephanus seemed bent on a quarrel that night, although with whom it was not easy to say.
Clarence seemed to feel the insults the most keenly.
Ned Romer, however, sat quietly, and watched the young Boer while he listened and waited.
For the first time a strong desire to measure his strength with this Dutchman came upon him--the kind of desire that young Zulus have when they want to wash their virgin spears.
A full moon shone over their heads and lighted up the level landscape with pale but vivid distinctness.
"Well," at last observed Clarence, with a lisping drawl; he always spoke slow and lazy-like when primed up for fighting--"well, not being in Johannesburg during the time you speak about, Stephanus Groblaar, I cannot contradict you as to the colour of their flag; yet if I had been, I think I'd have done my best, young as I am, to show that there was an equal mixture of red and blue as well as white about it."
"Hold on till you get to Pretoria.
There we make Uitlanders walk with Kaffirs in the middle of the street."
"Is this the rule in Pretoria?"
asked Ned, gently.
"Yes, for the like of you; and we'll make them do the same in Johannesburg before we have done with them," cried Stephanus, turning on Ned with an ugly scowl.
I always like the side path, and I shall use that wherever I am," answered Ned, laughing.
Why, curs like you could not use this veldt as you like unless with our permission, far less the sides of our streets."
"Ah, indeed, Mr Groblaar," said Ned, rising to his feet slowly.
"Is there any particular portion of this place that you as a free burgher might prohibit tonight?"
"Yes; I defy you to pass me now."
They were all standing now with the exception of the cousin Groblaar, who lay on his back snoring.
"Wait a moment, Ned," said Clarence, softly.
"I think Stephanus only meant to stop me from walking past him."
"No," growled the Boer; "I did not mean you.
I don't want to interfere with you, nor with Fred either, for you are both colonial born and bred.
It is this cur of a John Bull that I'd teach to keep his place."
"Good," answered Ned.
"Then this cur of a John Bull accepts your gentlemanly challenge, and will show you that he knows his place, and that place is, whatever spot of the earth he finds it expedient for the advance of civilisation to tread upon."
He walked steadily up to the Boer with his arms held limply down; then, before the other could put up his fists, Ned suddenly gripped him and sent him sprawling some feet away, while he stood where Stephanus had been.
"This is Imperial ground, you Dutch Boer, upon which the Lion of Britain permits your people to play for the present."
It was a grand speech, which Ned felt proud to give voice to, and which his chums cheered.
Another clear voice behind them cried, "Bravo, young cub!"
but none looked round to hear who spoke.
Stephanus did not give them time for that.
With a hoarse roar he picked himself up, and made the rush like a wounded buffalo.
He was a powerful young man come to his full strength, whereas Ned Romer was only ripening.
But he was heavily built, and slow in his movements in spite of his rage.
He had not had the training nor discipline which Ned could boast of; and lastly, he had been drinking "Cape smoke" that day, which rendered him stupid and careless.
Possibly also the overweening conceit and insolence of his race made him contemptuous of this slender lad.
Ned, on the other hand, was in splendid condition, as lithe and agile as a young panther, and as quick in the glance as he was active and cool.
The past three months of horse exercise and open-air life had made his muscles like steel.
As Stephanus rushed upon him with swollen features and blood-charged eyes, Ned waited quietly; then, with a sudden spring aside, he shot out one fist, and landed the Dutchman a thumper on the bridge of his nose, which caused him to see a perfect flare of fireworks, while it made him stagger in his tracks.
For an instant he paused, and put up both hands to his bruised organ; then as he turned once more and removed his hands, a dark stream burst from his nostrils, and deluged his chin and shirt-front.
"First blood, and well drawn," cried the clear voice again.
"Go it, my hearty; you have shown him the red, let him have the blue next stroke."
Fred and Clarence glanced round, to see a tall, broad-chested stranger in a light suit and soft felt hat standing behind them, with his horse beside him and its bridle over his arm.
As he spoke Ned got in his second blow, and as the stranger had advised, smote his adversary higher up and right between the eyes.
It was a loud-sounding smash, which completely blinded Stephanus, and made it apparent to all the onlookers that he had received his blue badge.
"These will be pretty peepers tomorrow morning," said the stranger; then, making a hasty step forward, he raised his heavy riding-whip, as he exclaimed, "Ha!
you would show the white next, you treacherous dog, would you?
Drop that knife instantly."
As he spoke he brought the stock of his whip smartly upon the wrist of Stephanus, causing him to utter a loud yell, while his glittering sheath-knife dropped gleaming to the ground.
Holding his damaged wrist with one hand, the Transvaaler staggered blindly back, and abandoned the field to the calm and victorious Ned.
"He has had enough of your fists, young man, for the present, I expect, only be on your guard with him for the future.
Boers don't forget blows, neither do they care much about fighting in the open.
He will try a bead on you next from behind a kopje."
He was an immense figure of a man who had come out of the veldt so unexpectedly, considerably over six feet in height and broad in proportion.
His skin was ruddy, with bold features, light, keen eyes, and he wore a small, fair moustache.
As the boys looked at him, they each thought they had seen him somewhere before, but where they could not at the time remember.
There was about him an air of kingly authority which fascinated them.
"Have you any coffee left?"
he asked gently.
Clarence went instantly to the half-empty billy at the fire, and brought a pannikin filled.
The stranger took it with a nod, and slowly sipped the contents, looking at them scrutinisingly as he drank.
Cousin Groblaar still lay sleeping heavily within the shadow of one of the waggons.
Stephanus had moved away to some considerable distance to brood over his defeat and bathe his eyes and nose at a water-hole.
The Kaffirs were also sound asleep on their side of the fire, therefore they had this contested part of the veldt to themselves.
"You managed that onslaught in very good style, my lad, and have made for yourself a pretty dangerous enemy, or I am much mistaken in my reading of faces."
"An avowed enemy is better than a secret one, sir, and I have good reasons to suspect Stephanus Groblaar of being one before this night," replied Ned.
"Ah, Groblaar is his name!
Any friend of Groblaar, the vine-grower, of Stellenbosch?"
"His nephew, sir.
Yonder lies his son asleep."
"Let him sleep," said the stranger, hastily.
"Then the young man you punished must be the son of Burgher Groblaar, of Pretoria?"
"I believe so, sir.
At least, his home is in that city," answered Ned.
thanks for this information.
Then take my advice, part company with this Stephanus Groblaar as soon as possible, and also--don't air those Imperial ideas too freely when you are going to Johannesburg.
They are not fashionable there at present."
"I will never hear my nation insulted without resenting it, sir," replied Ned, boldly.
"Better swallow insult than run the risk of imprisonment."
"No, sir; I cannot endorse that sentiment."
"It is the sentiment generally held by the Transvaal Uitlanders."
"I do not care.
It shall never be mine."
"Nor mine!"
"Nor mine!"
cried Fred and Clarence in chorus.
"Good lads," said the stranger, in feeling tones, holding out his large hand to our heroes, who grasped it by turns.
"I like you for your pluck and freshness.
Tell me your names, so that I may remember them if I can serve you at any time."
The lads at once produced their cards and presented them.
The stranger smiled humorously as he took the paste-boards.
"Ah, you are fresh from England, I see.
All the better.
You will see some sad and humbling sights in Johannesburg.
But keep up your pluck, and don't forget that you are sons of a mighty nation of free men."
"Depend upon it we shall never do that, so long as the great Cecil Rhodes stays in Africa, at any rate."
The stranger started, and a dusky tint seemed to overspread his face.
Then he smiled and looked at the cards.
"Edward Romer!
I knew a Paul Romer, of Devonshire."
"That was my father, sir."
Then I must do something for you.
Clarence Raybold.
Ah, I know your father, if he lives at Johannesburg."
"He does, sir," answered Clarence.
The stranger looked at Fred with the others intently and silently for a few moments, then he drew nearer to Ned.
"You can save me a journey tonight, young Romer, for I think I can depend upon you as well as upon your companions."
"I trust you can, sir," replied Ned, modestly.
"On your discretion as well as your loyalty and courage?"
"I hope so, sir."
"Then I shall trust you."
He glanced round, and seeing the veldt clear and Stephanus still by the water-hole, he pulled a leaf from his pocket-book, and wrote something hastily upon it.
This small note he folded up and addressed, then he gave it to Ned.
"Put that inside your boot, and keep it there until you reach Johannesburg.
When you arrive there, look at the address, and deliver it to the person it is for.
You will find him easily.
Meantime, be secret about it, and show it to no one except the person it is for.
Much depends on its safe delivery--more on it not being taken from you or lost on the way.
If you carry it safely, you will have rendered your country and the man you appear to admire a great, a very great, service."
He sprang on his horse as he spoke, and, taking his hat off, waved it to them as he rode swiftly away.
"Remember that you are trusted by Cecil Rhodes.
We shall meet again."
He was off at a gallop, while our heroes looked after horse and man with open mouths.
"What a slice of luck, Ned!
Who could have expected it?"
whispered Fred and Clarence, as soon as they recovered from their astonishment.
Ned did not reply.
Kneeling down he took off his boot, and secreted the precious bit of paper inside; then he rose up with a bright and proud light gleaming in his eyes.
"It is, indeed, a piece of luck which we must all try to live up to," he said at length, in a solemn voice.
"My first skirmish with a Boer has resulted in an easy victory, and it has been witnessed by the greatest hero who lives.
Let us hail it as a good omen."
Stephanus Groblaar did not patronise the camp.
Either he was too much ashamed or too sulky to show himself so soon after his ignominious defeat.
While our heroes remained awake, his distant figure could still be seen bending over the waterhole.
After that frustrated and cowardly attempt to draw his knife upon Ned Romer, even Fred Weldon, who had been the most friendly disposed towards him, gave him up.
Neither English nor colonial-bred Britons could take the hand of a would-be assassin.
All the instincts of their race are against this, as they are against using the feet in a fight.
Only a Spaniard can endorse the one weapon, and a Frenchman tolerate the other mode of getting an advantage.
Spaniards stab, Frenchmen kick, and cats scratch when they quarrel; Englishmen clench their fists and strike, or grip and throw.
Inspired by the charge which had been given to them by their illustrious visitor, and influenced by his timely warning, our heroes resolved to part company with Stephanus and his cousin as soon as possible.
Meantime, to ward against possible treachery, they also resolved to be watchful and wary.
Therefore it was agreed that, while two slept, one would keep guard over the waggon.
This they did by turns faithfully until they reached Johannesburg.
Stephanus came to the waggon about midnight, while Fred was on duty.
He did not speak to Fred, nor did he go inside, but ordered one of the Kaffirs, whom he roused up for the purpose, to bring out a rug for him.
With this he sullenly retired to the shelter of one of the wine-drays, and there he spent the night.
He was taking his beating in a nasty and Boer-like spirit.
In the morning he appeared at breakfast wearing a large pair of smoke-coloured sun-spectacles, and his nose considerably enlarged.
He did not make any remarks about the preceding evening, and his good-natured and unobservant cousin never noticed that there was anything amiss.
The boys took their cue from this sulky Dutchman, and made no allusion to it either.
As they were about to inspan, a party of armed burghers came on the scene, and gave them a foretaste of what they had to expect during their stay in the Transvaal.
They represented the mounted police, or border tax-collectors.
Well mounted and armed to the teeth, they rode in and delayed the start for a couple of hours, while they examined every packet most thoroughly.
They were particularly rude and insolent to the three young Uitlanders, tumbling their packages about roughly, and scattering the contents over the ground in a reckless and wanton manner, as if desirous of destroying what they could not seize.
All the ammunition and arms they took possession of, telling the young men that they would be sent on to Johannesburg, where, if they could gain permission from the authorities there, they might get them, or part of them, returned.
The police gave no promise, however, neither did they favour them with any list of what they had taken.
In fact, as the boys felt, with raging hearts, they were being treated exactly like prisoners in an enemy's country.
They were fleeced and left utterly defenceless, with the exception of their belt-knives.
This was all the harder to bear when they saw that Stephanus and his cousin were permitted to retain their rifles, revolvers, and cartridges.
It was privileges for the Boer, and none for the Uitlander.
They protested against this gross injustice, but were told roughly that they ought to be thankful that they were not taken in charge for bringing arms of any kind into the country.
Also, to their indignation, they were subjected to a close personal search, and every paper they had in their pockets opened and read.
Ned now understood why he had been told to place that missive inside his boot, for even their shirts were felt over to see that they had nothing concealed inside.
They were certainly at last inside a land of suspicion and gross tyranny.
"So this is the result of democracy," said Ned, with a bitter laugh.
"I suppose every man here is either a tyrant, a traitor, or a spy."
"Take heed what you say, young fellow," grunted one of the Boer policemen.
"Remember you are not in England now, but in a country where wagging tongues are silenced pretty quickly."
you need not remind me that I am not in England.
Your actions have proved conclusively that we are subject to the glorious laws of the Republic.
By Jove, though, I wonder what my countrymen would say if a foreigner was treated to this usage in England?
wouldn't there be a public conflagration!"
"We are free men here."
"You are, whatever your visitors may be."
The policeman looked at Ned with a suspicious and most unfriendly scowl.
"Are you going to stay long in the Transvaal, younker?"
"I don't think so.
"Because I fancy, if you were, that you would be likely to spend most of your time in the tronk and the stocks.
That is where your sort mostly find a home here."
Ned prudently did not reply.
His shirt had been examined and his pockets turned out.
He did not want to have to unlace his boots next.
"I'll report that younker as a dangerous character.
Keep an eye on him as you go along," cried the chief to the Groblaars, as he rode off with his men.
Stephanus took no part in this conversation, while his cousin only chuckled good-naturedly, as if it were a good joke.
He was an easy-going fellow, and did not let anything trouble him much beyond the keeping of the wine cool and the oxen in good condition.
It was about four o'clock the third afternoon after this that they lumbered into Johannesburg amidst a cloud of dust, and unharnessed for the last time together.
Our heroes said good-bye with all friendliness to the vine-grower's son; and with a cold word or two to the still sullen Stephanus, they went off together to the house of Clarence Raybold, senior.
Taking it all through, their journey up-country had been an educating and a pleasant one.
They had passed through a prosperous land, full of variety and strangeness.
They had met all sorts of people, both white and coloured, and every description of pastures.
They were brown with the fierce sun and covered with the white dust, and totally changed, outwardly and inwardly, from the schoolboys who left England such a little time ago.
They had killed puff adders and other deadly snakes on their way, and had got over their shuddering horror for those obnoxious reptiles.
They had also seen the best side of the Boer character, and had commenced to experience the other side--the Boer in power, with their countrymen under his feet.
It was a new and a disagreeable experience to those proud young Britons to find their countrymen in the condition of serfs and door-mats, with clumsy and ignorant clowns tramping over them ruthlessly.
As they walked through the streets of Johannesburg, and saw at every step evidences of the misrule of that hypocritical and false tyrant, Kruger, they felt a natural and deep disgust towards the Englishmen who had permitted such a condition of things to exist.
They met gangs of Boers swaggering about fully armed, and jeering at the unarmed citizens.
They saw Britons, or what looked like their countrymen, sneaking about and meekly eating the leek.
Their generous young blood boiled within them as they looked up at the guns which the hoary tyrant of the Transvaal had planted on the fort to overawe the city.
They felt as if they were inside the walls of a big prison, and every instinct within them moved towards rebellion.
From the moment they caught sight of that fort, with the guns dominating the streets, they were filled with a hatred towards the Boers and a quenchless desire for slaughter.
"I wonder what our people out here are made of to stand this sort of thing?"
murmured Ned, as he looked at his chums' blazing eyes.
"Surely some of them have enough of the old blood left to risk it for the sake of liberty."
"I'll not be able to stand it long," answered Clarence, with a deep-drawn breath.
"It will be a lark if we are destined to light the spark," continued Ned, musingly.
"I think we could get over these walls some dark night without much trouble.
Oh, let's get on, boys, or I'll be after having a try now," he added impatiently, as he strode hastily forward.
"There, now, who do you think you are shoving against?"
he cried angrily, as he ran against a pair of burghers who were coming round a corner.
It was Ned who had been at fault in his haste.
In any other place he would have apologised, but seeing that they were Boers, he pushed them off the footpath and then turned to abuse them.
It was the natural protest of a free man against unaccustomed tyranny.
With those Krupp guns behind them, politeness looked like submission and fear.
Fortunately for the safety of that billet in Ned's boot, which he had for the moment forgotten, these burghers were good-tempered and stolid Dutchmen, who didn't mind either a push or a cross word.
They merely laughed boisterously, and passed on their way.
Now, Ned felt both aggrieved and rebuked by the good nature of these Boers, who doubtless considered him to be a foolhardy fellow rendered extra brave through "Cape smoke."
Then he remembered his charge, and became utterly ashamed of his uncalled-for rudeness.
He would have run after the burghers and apologised, only that might have made matters worse; besides, they had both gone into some building.
"That is not how Cecil Rhodes acted when he was being badgered by some of the commissioners, nor what he advised," Ned muttered to himself, as he bent his head with shame.
"I must try to remember always that I am a gentleman, and not act like a clown."
At this moment Clarence proposed taking a cab, as the easiest and quickest mode of finding out his father's house.
Mr Raybold was one of the prominent citizens, and the moment the Jehu heard his name he knew where to drive to.
"You have most chance of finding him at his private residence, if you want to see Mr Raybold personally."
"Yes," answered Clarence.
"Drive us straight there."
What a wonderful city this was, which had grown from nothing within the last six years!
Grown up also in the teeth of as much discouragement and injustice as ever civilisation had to encounter, from narrow prejudice, extortion, and bigotry.
Our heroes drove along streets fifty and ninety feet in width, with trams running through them, and massive, handsome shops lining them, with plate-glass windows, looking for all the world like some of the best West End London shops.
It was a city where money was spent with lavish prodigality.
There were crowds of flash hotels and clubs, and more than the ordinary number of low public-houses and canteens, every one crowded with thirsty customers.
They passed banks, stores, and palatial-looking offices, with electric globes and gas lamps ranged over them.
They passed crowds of fashionably dressed men and women, all seemingly busy and lively enough.
In spite of those earthworks and guns which covered them wherever they went; in spite of the constantly blazoned fact that they were completely at the mercy of their armed masters, who patrolled the city as warders do a penal settlement,--they were allowed to earn and spend as much money as they pleased, after paying the exorbitant taxes, dress as they please, and drink what they could pay for.
But they had no more civic rights than convicts or slaves have.
They had no means to defend their women or children from insult.
The male portion wore beards and dressed like men, but they were only men in outward appearance.
They might as well have had chains upon their wrists and ankles.
They were voluntary slaves and shadow citizens.
They were just what their rude masters called them--Uitlanders--and on the same level as the vanquished and down-trodden Kaffirs.
Yet they called themselves British, afraid as they were to show the Flag of England or to sing the National Anthem; all they could do was to dress, drink, and make money, and, like the servile clients of ancient Rome, bend their supple backs to their arrogant and uncouth patrons, and thank them for permission to live.
Sixty thousand souls who had been born free, for the sake of gold bent the knee before sixteen thousand uncultivated retarders of civilisation.
Their condition was ten times worse than that of the Scots when Edward enslaved them with his overpowering hosts.
More degrading, because they were children of the nineteenth century, who had consented to be driven by a race who had not advanced past the benighted and rusty prejudices of the dark ages of bigotry and superstition.
More shameful, since they outnumbered their tyrants five times over.
No wonder that these Boers regarded Britons with contempt, and the Empire as a fallen tree.
England was powerless to help the Uitlanders as long as they chose to remain inert and submissive under the yoke.
Dr Jameson and his dauntless band had demonstrated that no outside heroism could lift the yoke from their shoulders while they bent beneath it so passively.
Only from their own ranks must the Wallace and the Bruce rise to free them.
Ned and his chums had already read some of the literature of these Uitlanders, explaining and excusing themselves for their inaction during the Raid, or even supporting the tyrants in their oppression.
These books and pamphlets had, before they reached the country, made them grind their teeth with fury.
Fancy a Wallace and a Bruce waiting for the sanction of the Government before they took up their swords!
Fancy their supporters waiting for permission before they rose to help their heroes!
Our heroes, although consuming with those high-souled ideas which all brave and romantic boys must feel, and which the men of Johannesburg had apparently outgrown, still watched with wonder the mighty edifices they passed.
Their wonder increased as they came to the suburbs, and saw the avenues and tall, shady trees which had all sprung up like magic out of the bare veldt--stately groves, over a hundred feet in height, all created in six years; beautiful gardens, luxuriant shrubberies, costly and artistic villas, grassy lawns, orchards, and tropic climbers covering up unsightly places with cool and exquisite loveliness.
It was as if Aladdin had rubbed his magic lamp, and lo!
his enslaved genius had done the trick.
The Uitlanders were the enslaved genii that had wrought this miracle upon that treeless veldt.
Their civilised skill and educated intellects had accomplished what would have taken centuries to achieve under the Boer system.
Yet the ignorant Boers were the masters, and ruled over intellect and civilisation.
This, to our heroes, seemed even more incongruous and wonderful than the marvels which were spread out before them.
However had it come to pass?
However could it have gone on so long?
How much longer could it possibly continue?
They were still trying to solve the problem when they drove up through a delightful avenue of trees, and stopped in front of a large and stately mansion.
It was the Transvaal home of Clarence Raybold.
Everywhere they looked, the evidence of wealth and lavish outlay stared them in the face--in the grounds with its trees and lawns, which had been forced and kept green by expensive irrigation; in the vast columns and carved work of the masonry.
Mr Raybold had expended a fortune on the rearing of this suburban palace as a testimony to his wealth.
Even Clarence was impressed as he led the way up the steps and knocked at the heavy, polished front door.
Mr Raybold, although surrounded by so much luxury, was a bluff and hearty man, who put on no airs of dignity.
He welcomed his son with affectionate warmth and his two friends with genuine hospitality.
Clarence had written about their intentions from Cape Town, so that they were expected, and found their rooms all prepared.
While they were having something to eat to keep them going till dinner, a man was sent with a trap to bring their luggage.
Mr Raybold heard the account of their arms being taken by the Boers with a grim smile; but he made no other comment than to say he would do his best to have them returned, or kept safely for them until they left the Transvaal.
It was only when they were leaving the dining-room to have a bath and change their clothes, that he closed the door carefully, and said in an impressive undertone--  "Be very careful how you express any opinion about the Government, outside or inside.
Also trust no one, however friendly they may appear.
Remember always that we are as much under surveillance here as people are in Russia.
Paul Kruger has his spies and secret detectives everywhere."
"But this is most horrible," cried the boys together.
Mr Raybold merely shrugged his shoulders and smiled the same grim smile.
"Careless words are sometimes very costly in Johannesburg, and a silent tongue is worth a great deal more than its weight in gold here.
We don't talk much in society here, and never about politics."
"But your wrongs?"
asked Ned, "We leave that to the newspapers to air, and to those who have no money to be confiscated in fines."
The heart of Ned sank as he listened to these wise and prudent words of this successful citizen.
Gold was the chain which the Uitlanders had forged for themselves; and while the supply continued, it seemed hopeless to expect them to make any effort towards deliverance.
The three lads went off to dress themselves sadly and silently.
Clarence hung his head with shame for all the splendour which appeared so many tokens of his father's fall from independence; while his chums, out of sympathy and pity for him, refrained from looking at him.
It is terrible for a brave and generous boy to feel ashamed of his father.
Poor Clarence went into the sumptuous room appointed to him, and, after locking the door, he flung himself on a couch and groaned in the bitterness of his heart.
He remembered his father before he had come to the Transvaal and before he was quite so rich.
Thus he had good cause to look up to him with pride, for he was a strong, fearless, and self-reliant man, who could never have uttered such words as he had done that afternoon.
What a change those six years of tyranny had wrought in him!
He looked older now by a dozen years.
His eyes had lost their straight, outward look, and his face had become softer and flabbier, while his voice had no longer its decided ring.
All this was not the father he expected to meet.
He did not remember much about his mother, for she had died while he was very young.
Somehow he felt glad now for the first time to think that she had died before the Transvaal migration.
It would have utterly broken his heart had he seen the same servile look on her face as he had seen on his father's.
All at once he pushed those wretched feelings from his heart, to replace them by an increased hatred for the Boers who had wrought this evil--the old obstinate baboon of Pretoria, who stood and with his darkened mind stemmed the tide of civilisation.
Ah, how Clarence abhorred Oom Paul Kruger that afternoon!
Fred Weldon bathed and dressed himself quietly, thinking all the time upon poor Clarence, and wishing that he could comfort him, as Clarence had done when he lost his father.
He felt now that death was not the worst calamity which could happen to a boy with his father.
Time cured that; but what could cure the death of respect?
"Perhaps he is only lying low, like Brer Rabbit, and playing Indian for a special purpose.
That would be quite fair in a game of this kind.
I must give old Clar this idea and hope."
He grew cheerful after this, and very soon persuaded himself that such must be the case.
Indeed, before he had finished dressing he was mentally regarding Mr Raybold as a dark conspirator, only waiting events to ripen, to blossom out into a daring hero of the William Tell order.
Ned, when he got into his room, also locked his door behind him; then he unlaced his boots, and putting his hand inside, pulled out the folded sheet of paper.
It was not so clear as he should have liked, but the address was readable and the paper intact.
He was too honourable to open the missive, although, had he done so, he would have been no wiser, as the contents were written in cypher.
The address was as follows:--  "Mr Philip Martin, Johannesburg."
Having read it, and noted the name, he wrapped it up within a clean piece of note-paper, and placed it for the time within his purse.
He meant to ask his host that night if he knew this gentleman, and if so, he would call upon him after dinner.
But by good luck, when he got down to the library, where Mr Raybold was waiting for his young guests, he found the very man he wanted.
He had come to dine with Mr Raybold.
Ned looked at the man whom the great empire-maker had written to with interest, nor was he disappointed in his ideal.
Philip Martin was a strong man, and looked a bold one also.
He was about five feet eight inches in height, with a deep, wide chest and a massive neck.
He had a good deal the air of a sailor about him, which his navy-blue serge suit and turned-down collar helped.
His eyes were dark and piercingly bright, while over them were thick black eyebrows.
His beard was cut short and pointed, and his features were pronounced, while his complexion was swarthy.
He was quick and decided in his motions, and had a sonorous voice that loomed through the room.
Altogether he looked a man of strength, character, and indomitable will.
Just the sort of man that Ned could admire.
Ned opened his purse, and took out his note, removing the outer covering without being observed.
Then, watching his chance when he was left alone with Mr Martin, he approached him, and said--  "I think this is for you, Mr Martin.
I got it from a gentleman on the veldt three nights ago."
Mr Martin opened the note carelessly; then, as soon as he saw the contents, he started, and crushed it quickly into his pocket.
"You have not shown any one this note, have you?"
"No; I was told to be careful about it, and give it only to you, sir."
"What kind of man was it who gave it to you?"
"It was the Honourable Cec--"  "Hush!
I am satisfied.
It is all right.
Do not say any more."
He went over to the fire, and after reading it carefully, he put it amongst the logs, and watched it burn; then he stirred the ashes with his foot, and turned once more to Ned.
"You have done a great service in giving me this so promptly, and I shall be happy if I can serve you in return."
"I was too proud to be entrusted with it, sir."
"Then you are one of the writer's many admirers, I presume?"
There is no man I admire so much or would like to serve more."
Mr Martin looked at Ned keenly for some time without speaking, then he said--  "The writer of that note tells me I may trust you and your companions.
He is seldom wrong in his reading of character, and in this instance my own opinion agrees with his, respecting you at least.
I haven't seen your chums yet."
"You may safely trust us all to the death, sir, in anything honourable.
We have sworn to stick together."
"To the death, you say!
Well, I may even want as desperate a pledge as that.
But can I trust your temper and discretion?"
Ned blushed as he remembered his afternoon fit of passion, but he replied firmly--  "I hope so, sir."
"Had you that note on you this afternoon when you assaulted those two Boers?"
Ned hung his head guiltily.
Yet he answered truthfully--  "Yes, sir.
The sight of the fort made me lose my head for a moment, but it shall not occur again."
"You ran a frightful risk," answered Mr Martin, severely.
"The incident took place just opposite my window, and I saw it all, and expected you to be taken in charge.
If you had been, that paper would have been discovered, and more damage done to the cause of freedom and federation than you at present could imagine.
There, I shall not lecture you any more; only remember that to provoke a street row is not the way to qualify for a patriot.
Say no more about this now, but after dinner I shall take you and your friends for a walk, show you some of the town by night, and perhaps also let you see how you may help the Uitlanders and--you know who else."
He pressed our hero's hand warmly, as a token of his forgiveness, and at once began to ask him questions about his journey up the country.
Mr Raybold came back while they were conversing, and then shortly afterwards Clarence and Fred.
Almost at the same moment the dinner-gong sounded, and together they went in to dinner.
In the lobby Mr Martin whispered something in the ear of Mr Raybold, who at once turned and looked with interest at Ned.
That look cleared up the doubts of Ned like magic, so that he laid hold of Clarence, and said to him tenderly--  "Cheer up, old chappy; your dad is all right!"
"Do you think so, Ned?
Fred is of the same opinion."
"I don't think--I know, and so will you before the night is over.
Take his advice and mine.
Be discreet, for silence is golden.
Just you wait a bit."
"Thank God!"
answered Clarence, softly, a sudden moisture coming into his rich brown eyes.
Mr Philip Martin was an intelligent and entertaining speaker, with enough of the boy still about him to make him understand and interest our heroes.
His age was thirty-two, and he had both travelled and read a great deal.
A South African by birth and descent of three generations, all his sympathies and hopes lay in his native land.
England, or rather Scotland, had been the original home of his ancestors, and their traditions of liberty and independence were not forgotten.
But it was Africa, not Scotland, which held all that was most sacred to him.
He had come to Johannesburg to superintend one of the mines, the same one from which Mr Raybold drew most of his immense income.
Philip Martin was therefore a man with no personal vested interests in the Transvaal beyond his salary.
He could therefore leave whenever he liked this inhospitable soil to Uitlanders.
He could also plot and conspire, without the same risks that Mr Raybold ran.
This perhaps rendered him more daring and independent than his host.
During dinner, when not talking about the market, they conversed on indifferent subjects.
Mr Martin seemed chiefly interested in hearing all about the life the lads had led at school.
Ned had a notion that this bright, strong, swarthy man, with his air of interest, was drawing them out for some purpose of his own, and was reading them all the time he asked questions and listened to their replies.
But he did not mind being studied, as his record and those of his companions were clean ones.
Besides, he found it a pleasure to give his confidence to this man, for already he liked him very greatly, and felt that he would not be misjudged.
So the three lads rattled on, recalling incidents of victories won in the class and in the field, while Mr Martin listened with his keen, bright eyes glowing upon them alternately, as if in his heart he was moving again with them through those merry past times.
Mr Raybold also sat looking at them and listening with the indulgent smile of a genial host, who is pleased to find his guests enjoying themselves.
It was a good dinner, and the lads did full justice to it, in spite of their chatter, for they had brought with them good travellers' appetites.
The solids disappeared rapidly as they were placed before them, without in the least spoiling their zest for the dessert.
The wines, however, they did not touch, which Mr Martin also abstained from.
Mr Raybold was the only one who indulged in anything stronger than water.
"What do you drink?"
asked Mr Martin, during a pause.
"Water," answered our heroes.
"Right you are.
That is my tipple also when I can get it; but in Africa one has to grow accustomed to moderate their desires even in this indulgence--particularly when on an exploring expedition."
"And that was our intention in coming out to Africa."
"You'll have your chance, never fear.
There is plenty of ground yet left to explore, and lots of big game to bag up country."
Clarence looked wistfully and affectionately at his father during the dinner, who returned his glances with tenderness.
The abject expression which Mr Raybold had seemed to have worn in the afternoon had now been replaced by an air of placid content and kindliness.
Clarence felt greatly relieved, and began to regain hope and confidence.
"Are you going to the club tonight, Philip?"
"Yes; I'll look in there about ten o'clock.
Shall you be there?"
"Yes; I think so," replied the capitalist, quietly.
"I have a few calls to make first."
"I suppose you don't object to me taking the youngsters, to show them about?"
If you consider them old enough, I don't greatly object."
There was not much heartiness in Mr Raybold's tones, and he looked in the direction of his son with a slightly troubled eye, while he rubbed his chin reflectively.
"Oh, I'll vouch for them, and take care that they do not get into any scrapes also," answered Mr Martin, confidently.
"Very well; I'll trust them under your wing.
Come into my sanctum and have a cigar first."
Mr Raybold rose and led the way with a pleasant smile; then, dismissing the servant who had followed them with coffee, he locked the door, and turned round to Philip Martin with a stern face--  "Look here, Philip, I don't like this!
I am risking the biggest part of my fortune, and possibly my own life, to help on the cause, but I draw the line at giving up my son also."
Clarence sprang forward with a joyous cry, and flung his arms impulsively round his father's neck.
"Oh, father, how happy you have made me by those words!
So you are not, after all, a tame serf?"
"Wait, Clarence.
I am speaking to Mr Martin at present," said his father, gravely, at the same time pushing him away gently.
"I have learnt enough from these lads, Mr Raybold, to know that no power on earth will keep them out of the fun if they live in Johannesburg," answered Philip Martin, calmly.
"If we don't show them what is going on under the surface, they are too recently from the home of freedom to be able to endure the life here."
"I can send them away."
To Rhodesia, where they will be picked up and utilised by our friends outside?"
Mr Raybold remained silent, as if he had not a reply handy.
"Best get them initiated first," continued Philip, "and then they will be able to hold their own.
Cecil Rhodes has already seen them, and trusts them, young as they are; and you know he is not the man to make many mistakes.
Besides, think of your son's feelings.
He must respect his father.
Just give him a chance to speak for himself."
"Yes, father; let us go with Mr Martin.
I want to be proud as well as fond of my father.
We all want to help to shake down this horrible tyranny, and we can be trusted."
"Those are our sentiments, sir," echoed Ned and Fred--"to be of some service to the British, and help to wipe out those ugly stains that now lie on our flag."
"My lads," answered Mr Raybold, gravely, "it is not that I do not trust you, but that I fear to risk you.
What has to be done is our business, not yours--men's work, not boys'."
"Where a father goes, surely it is a son's duty to follow," said Clarence.
"We'll take the risk.
And if we are boys, we are able to fight as well as most men, and run a good deal faster, if running is the game," added Ned, with a flash in his eyes.
"Besides," said Fred, quietly, "we know too much already not to know more."
Philip Martin laughed, and cried--  "That clinches it, I fancy.
Come, Mr Raybold, I'd rather have these three youngsters in our ranks than a dozen of some fellows I know."
"I must yield, I suppose," answered Mr Raybold, with a regretful sigh.
"Only I wish I could have kept you out of this hornets' nest, Clarence.
Be careful, though, now that you are about to become conspirators, for we have a very wily enemy to hoodwink."
He went over to where the cigars were and took one, which he cut and lit, while he offered the box to Philip.
"I'll call the committee meeting for half-past ten.
That will give you time to look round the town, Philip."
"Yes; that will do nicely.
Come, boys, if you are ready we'll start."
They found horses already saddled waiting for them at the front door, and together they cantered down the avenue and out to the main road.
The moon was just rising as they started, and very soon it was shining upon their faces and casting long black shadows behind them.
The three boys were filled with eagerness, not so much to see the town as to be introduced to that mysterious club.
They had about four miles to ride before they reached the centre of the city, and through most of this distance they were passing private villas and gardens.
The mines were situated on the other side of the city.
Under the silver lustre of the moon, with the dark mystery of shadow which the shrubs and trees cast, these suburbs appeared to be centuries old.
From the window-blinds of the mansions shone the mellow lamplights, while the sounds of singing and music all added to the charm of that warm and radiant night.
Many people were out on the road, enjoying the beauty of the night-- parties on horseback, lovers, natives, and not a few children.
They all appeared happy and careless enough.
Soon they came to the more crowded parts, all brightly lighted up with electric globes and gas-jets.
Many of the shops were still open and doing a thriving trade.
The hotels and canteens were, as usual, crowded, while the side paths were filled with pedestrians.
All the citizens of Johannesburg seemed to be on the streets at this time, and a strange gathering of nationalities they were.
"We have some of the worst blackguards on the face of the globe here," observed Philip, as they rode slowly along Pritchard Street.
"And some of the greatest cowards also, I should say," replied Ned.
"You are right; blackguards are very seldom brave men, although, of course, there are exceptions to every rule."
"I see Israel is to the fore here."
"Yes; that is one of the causes of our past failure.
A Jew will never risk his property nor person for any cause outside of business.
We don't admit Jews nor Germans into the club where we are going tonight, nor, of course, Dutchmen either."
"I suppose we must not ask any questions about your club now?"
asked Ned, timidly.
"No; we shall dismount here, and leave our horses for the present.
One thing I must ask of you, and that is, whatever you may see on the streets, do not interfere.
This is a rough city, after dark particularly, and swarming with the vilest of both sexes.
Yet restrain your generous instincts and do not pause either to remonstrate or protest.
You will see and hear much to raise your just indignation, but keep your feelings under, or you will be of no use to the cause."
It was a timely warning, and the boys acted upon it, although their chivalrous feelings were sorely tried during that night walk.
Almost from the moment they turned from the hotel, where they left their horses, to the time they entered the club-house, their eyes and ears were affronted by evidences of unbridled licence and brutal tyranny.
All the inhabitants appeared to be more or less under the influence of drink, women as well as men.
They were generally all well dressed, most of them overdressed, while on shirt-fronts and bare necks blazed out flashing diamonds.
"Are there no respectable people in Johannesburg?"
asked the boys in astonishment.
"The respectable people mostly stay at home on nights like this," replied Philip.
"What you see are the scum of nations drawn here by the scent of gold, as vultures are to a battlefield.
These are the camp followers of the great god Mammon, greater foes to freedom and progress than are the Boers.
They are nearly all either thieves, spies, or reasonless beasts."
It was a gay sight and for ever changing.
The women with their shining dresses and flashing diamonds looked like fireflies as they flaunted along under the electric lights from canteen to canteen.
Tram-cars, Cape carts, cabs, and horsemen filled up the centre of the streets, while black men, and whites, showing prominent noses and smoking enormous cigars, passed to and fro incessantly.
And amongst them swaggered shaggy-bearded and badly dressed Boers, scowling or jeering coarsely at the crowd they pushed so rudely through.
They heard one drunken fellow begin to shout out, "Rule, Britannia," but he was immediately seized by a couple of Zarps and dragged off to prison.
No one interfered on his behalf, nor did our heroes feel much pity either; he had such an atrocious rasping voice that they were almost grateful to the Boers for silencing it.
At last they turned down a quiet street, and soon reached a house where the front door stood wide open, and where the first-flat windows were lighted up.
"This is our club," said Philip, as they entered.
There was an office in the hall where lay a visitors' book.
In this he entered their names, with his own.
Then, with a nod to the silent hall-keeper, he showed them upstairs.
"Our reading-room," Philip said, as he ushered them into a large room comfortably furnished.
There were a good number of gentlemen assembled, reading papers and magazines, or writing.
Philip looked about him keenly, and, nodding to several, took a chair and touched the electric bell.
Almost immediately a waiter entered from another room.
"The committee are waiting for you, sir," whispered the waiter to Philip.
"All right.
Excuse me for a few moments, boys.
You will find all the latest magazines here, and I'll not be long."
He went out of the room, and left them to amuse themselves as they best could amongst the papers and magazines.
They had not very long to wait, however, before he returned and said--  "Now, boys, come with me, and I'll show you the other parts of these premises."
There was nothing about the premises of the Three Ace Club so far to show its character.
It was entered as a non-political club for British Africanders.
As drink and gambling were strictly prohibited, and its object was more for reading than social intercourse or discussion, it was regarded as a very slow affair by the majority of the community, and only patronised by the most staid and respectable.
A considerable number of members, however, were entered upon its books, and as far as subscriptions went, it was in a flourishing enough condition.
It had been organised since the fiasco of 1896, and although Uncle Paul had regarded it with suspicion at first, its respectable and sleepy character had allayed even his suspicions.
Philip Martin led the boys up to the second landing, and then, taking them into a bedroom, he shut the door.
"I am about to confide in you, my lads, a secret which you must promise never to reveal to any one."
"You may depend upon us."
"I feel I can, otherwise I should not have brought you here.
You may have read about the insurrection of 1896, when the Boers disarmed the citizens.
They were disappointed in only finding four thousand rifles instead of the thirty thousand they were led to expect."
"Yes; it was generally thought that the reformers had been boasting."
"That was the general impression, and so I also thought before I came to Johannesburg and was initiated."
"Had they this number of weapons?"
"Yes; more than that number, as you will see presently."
"Then why did the cowards hold back and allow Dr Jim to be defeated?"
"Because, firstly, they had a majority of cowards amongst them; and, secondly, because they were not properly organised, and the leaders were afraid to trust their men.
Now, however, we have altered all that.
Come with me, and you will see our arsenal."
He opened the door of a wardrobe which stood at the side of the wall, and, pulling out the drawer first, he touched a secret spring, and immediately the bottom moved up and showed them a flight of stairs underneath.
"This is the way down.
You go first, while I close the entrance."
He had only to pull back the drawer from the inside, and the aperture was securely fastened, wardrobe door and all.
He struck a wax vesta, and showed them their course down the steps, which were like the steps down to the stoke-holes of an ocean liner.
"These steps can all be raised and laid flat against the ceilings of each landing, as well as covered from sight, at a moment's notice," explained Philip, as they went down.
"In the flat below, which we entered, is a press, through which we pass, with shelves that drop down when the ladders are raised."
"It is very ingenious."
"Very, and unless a traitor showed the working, quite impossible to discover.
We are now passing through the pantry on the ground floor.
Now we are below the street."
The steps they had used hitherto were composed of iron, felt covered, but now they were descending solid stone stairs, also carpeted with thick felt to deaden the sound of their feet.
The walls and roof were likewise composed of stone and covered with cement, while at regular intervals along the ceiling were electric globes, which gave them plenty of light.
They went down about forty of these stone steps before they came to level ground, and then, before them, they saw a long, straight, and well-lighted lobby with an arched roof.
"This is the secret of the Three Ace Club.
We have to take precautions when we have the like of Oom Paul to deal with," remarked Philip, with a smile.
"Here you may make as much noise as you like, for no one outside could hear even a gun report.
We have stopped the echo."
"It must have cost something to excavate this vault," said the boys.
"Yes; a good deal of Rand money has been sunk here.
But come and see our shooting-gallery, arsenal, and general meeting-place."
He led the way along the lobby until they came to a door, against which he gave three loud knocks, at the same time pressing a knob.
Immediately the door opened, and they entered.
An underground hall of four hundred feet spread before them, in which were assembled a number of men.
It was lighted like the lobby by electricity, and lined, floor, coiling, walls, and doors, with felt.
At the far end were placed three targets, and all round on racks, from floor to ceiling, were rifles.
Not thirty thousand, but over a hundred thousand weapons, were here placed ready for use.
Along two sides were placed a row of maxim guns.
Ted counted thirty to each side.
He also noticed that there were several doors at different parts of this vast gallery.
Philip Martin saw their amazement, and smiled again.
"You see we are not altogether so much at the mercy of the Boers as they fondly imagine.
That door to your right leads off to our magazine, where we have sufficient ammunition for our purpose.
That other door on your left leads to a tunnel which we are at present engaged in boring.
When finished it will take us into the fort where Kruger has fixed his Krupps.
We are more than two-thirds on the way now.
Those other doors are exits, and lead to different parts of the city.
Oh yes, when next we rise, if we are forced, it shall not be against our wives and children that the fort guns will be discharged.
We'll use them for another purpose, and be much obliged to Oom Paul for his valuable gift."
Philip Martin was treating these young novices as if they were sage men, which proved his knowledge of human nature.
If you wish a boy to act like a man, treat him like a man, and respect his amour propre.
He was showing them round as if they were distinguished visitors, and opening his mind to them with a frankness that won their hearts completely.
It flattered their self-respect and quickened their reflective faculties.
They felt that they were expected to feel, speak, and act like the men they were amongst, and whose lives were entrusted to their discretion.
Then they become grave, attentive, and observant, and got into the proper mood for the work that lay before them.
In England men are apt to underrate boys, therefore they grow slowly.
Napoleon never made this mistake, but then he was young himself when he became a man, and moulded his ideas from the youthful heroes of the great past.
Philip Martin, like Napoleon, had the timely quality of being able to appreciate young men.
He knew from experience that heroism comes more natural to a youth than to a sage.
Johannesburg had been chock-a-block with prudent sages during the last conspiracy, which had so miserably failed.
He meant to work with enthusiasts this time--have men who needed curbing instead of urging.
The effect of this treatment was that our heroes, however much amazed they were at what they saw, managed to control their feelings, and look coolly about them.
The only thing which caused them regret was, every arrangement had already been made, and they seemed to have arrived too late to be of the slightest use.
"Johannesburg seems to be already in the hands of your party, Mr Martin.
I fear we can be of but small service to you," said Ned, sadly.
"Don't think such a thing, my lad," replied Philip, warmly.
"The message you brought in from Cecil Rhodes entitles you to our deepest gratitude, as you will know perhaps presently.
It was too important a bit of paper to be trusted to an ordinary messenger, and as you are a new-comer and young, you and your friends are just the kind we most urgently require.
As for Johannesburg being in our hands because we have weapons, and will soon be able to hold the fort, that is of very little advantage to us while the Home Government work with the Boers and forbid us to claim our rights.
We are helpless, even with this arsenal in our midst, to do more than protect our lives if our masters wantonly attack us.
We must wait for them to begin hostilities.
Say, are you fair marksmen?"
"Not first rate, but we have had some practise in Stellenbosch."
"Then go over to the rack there and select rifles, and amuse yourselves by trying to get some bull's-eyes, while I talk to the committee about the news you have brought us.
I'll introduce you presently, and get you enrolled as members of our Three Ace Club."
"What a strange name!
Why do you call it this?"
"Because we believe we hold `three aces' at present in the game we are playing against this rotten Republic.
Oom Paul believes he holds all the aces.
We give him credit of one, but that, we fear, is the trump.
However, we don't despair.
With good luck and hanging on, I hope we may yet be able to call our party the four ace club yet.
Then we can exhibit our hands."
He took the boys over to where a party of young men were standing, and introduced them, telling them to fix them up with cartridges and have some practice.
Then he went and joined some of the elders, amongst whom Clarence saw his father.
They were received in a very friendly way by the young fellows.
That they were there at all was guarantee enough for their principles.
For the next half-hour their attention was fully occupied by the target in front of them.
Out of a dozen shots each, Ned put nine into the centre, Clarence eight, and Fred ten, at the four hundred yards.
They were congratulated by their companions, and would have been fairly satisfied only that they found the others so much better.
Out of six dozen of the other cartridges, only one struck the other edge of the mark; the other seventy-one went straight, one over the other, right in the centre.
The man who struck the edge looked disgusted with himself.
As for those other nine misses, they could easily be counted on the white.
The self-satisfaction of our heroes died away at their own miserable display.
They felt suddenly as if they were worthy only of contempt.
"It isn't at all bad shooting for the first try at a new target," said the young men, encouragingly.
"You must remember that we spend most of our evenings here, drilling and practising."
That was something in their favour certainly.
"You must join our squad; we go through our manoeuvres here every night from seven till ten o'clock.
We have the very best instructors in the British Army to teach us, and I reckon we will make a good show when the time arrives to show our paces above the ground."
Our heroes resolved that, while they remained in Johannesburg, they would fill out their evenings in this way.
While they had been shooting, Philip Martin and the council were engaged in another part of the hall discussing politics.
The message which Philip delivered to them seemed to give them universal satisfaction.
But they were finished now, for Philip came forward and called the boys.
"I am happy to tell you that you have been accepted as members of this society.
Come and be sworn in."
They followed him over to a table, where the secretary of the society was seated with the roll-book in front of him.
"Young gentlemen," he said, "I am pleased to welcome you to Johannesburg, and proud to accept you as volunteers to the cause of liberty and the rights of Englishmen.
Our cause is a just and a holy one, which must commend itself to every loyal member of the British race, whichever home he hails from.
Our objects are threefold: first, to uphold the power and honour of our Empire, which means the spread of civilisation and humanity; secondly, the harmony and unity of Africa, and the federation of all our colonies under the protection of this Empire of Great Britain; thirdly, the downfall of all tyrants and traitors to the Empire.
Experience has taught us that the Boer Government is an impossibility, and that while they, the Boers, have authority, there can be no peace or progress in Africa.
They have denied us all the rights of human beings, and disgraced our name.
They have shown us that they are our enemies and evil wishers.
They have cajoled us too often for us to trust them any more, for they have proved themselves to be crafty, cruel, and pitiless savages, utterly unworthy of a place among nations.
Therefore we are banded together to destroy this Dutch Republic in Africa, and restore the land, that traitors to England gave to these enemies, once again to the Empire as it was before.
We are banded to unite the whole of South Africa under one flag, and that flag must be the British flag.
Are you prepared to swear that you will help us to achieve this end, and wipe away the stains which these savages have placed upon that flag?"
"We are," answered our heroes, earnestly.
"With all your energies--with the last drop of your blood, if called upon?"
"Swear also that you will be faithful to the trust we repose in you from this night, obedient to the command of those officers who may be placed over you, and true to your comrades."
"We swear to be faithful, obedient, and true to the cause."
"These are the three aces which form our watchword--loyalty, obedience, and good faith.
Now sign your names here, and receive your badge."
Our heroes went home with Mr Raybold that night proud that they were at least members of this noble brotherhood, and prepared to live and die worthy of the small joined aces which they carried in their pockets.
The life which our heroes led for the next few weeks in Johannesburg, although excessively useful, was not momentous.
They learned to be sure of hitting the centre of the bull's-eye with every shot.
Also, what would be of more service in actual Boer warfare, they mastered the science of taking a bead swiftly and hitting a rapidly moving object.
Sword and bayonet exercises were not neglected, nor horse and foot drill.
They saw the miners at work on the tunnel that was slowly crawling towards the German-filled fort, and helped to carry the debris through one of the several exits.
This was the most delicate part of the work, yet it was managed without much difficulty by the numerous members who composed the league.
During the daytime they walked about the city or rode over the veldt, getting gradually acquainted with most of their brothers, and learning whom to avoid amongst the inhabitants.
They no longer wondered why the former rising had ended in disaster.
Amongst all the crowds who were called Uitlanders not a sixth portion were, even at this time, bona fide Britishers.
At the time of Dr Jim's gallant raid they were not a twelfth part.
The rest of the population was made up of Russians, French, and German Jews, with a large sprinkling of other nationalities.
Germans mostly, however, predominated, and they made no secret of their deep and violent hatred of everything British.
Not a single Englishman was employed in any public department either in Johannesburg or anywhere else throughout the Transvaal.
The labourers even, who were employed by Government were either Germans or Hollanders when they were not Kaffirs.
In the highest posts were placed Boers, Hollanders, and Germans exclusively.
It was a clear case of "no English need apply" to any burgher employer.
The president, Paul Kruger, and his bigoted and ignorant Executive Council had got every concession which crafty greed and tyranny could get from cowardice and treason.
They had introduced German soldiers wholesale into their country, and purchased nearly all the arms and ammunition which had entered Africa for the past two years.
This, with blind and misplaced confidence, they had been allowed to do by the other colonists.
Indeed, throughout Cape Colony and Natal, the Dutch Africanders had been openly spending all their spare money in arming themselves, while the colonials, as a majority, had been watching them doing this, and neglecting to take the same precautions.
At the present moment, to all appearance, the Boers and their friends were the only effectively armed people throughout South Africa.
We must except, of course, those who were under the influence of Cecil Rhodes--the men of Rhodesia and the Three Ace Club league.
Affairs were in a fairly quiescent condition at present.
The citizens of Johannesburg had given over asking for their rights, and accepted each fresh insult and oppression quietly, and without outward remonstrance.
They knew such were utterly futile with that obstinate bigot, who regarded himself as an avenging instrument in the hands of the Lord.
Neither was it any secret what all these warlike preparations were aiming at.
If the Home Government shut its eyes, not a man, woman, or child in Africa but knew that the old man of Pretoria intended nothing less than the subjugating of Africa to the Boers, as soon as matters were ripe enough.
They would soon find excuses for their violence and treason when they were ready to begin.
As for the anarchy and massacres that would follow, they were satisfied that they would find plenty of defenders amongst the reptile gangs of Little Englanders, who were at present doing their utmost to help them in their work of destruction.
It was an open secret that the hated English were to be driven out of Africa, and the country torn from the empire.
This was to be the result of our clemency and weak indulgence to a race who understood only revenge and oppression.
The remorseless principles and inhuman tenets of the Boer religion belonged to those dark ages which civilisation and the true knowledge of Christianity has swept from the other portions of the globe where the Bible is known and honoured.
Their colonial history is a long record of steadfast atrocity and abuse of power.
Wherever they have trekked they have left a broad trail of blood and disaster.
Wherever they have settled, progress has ceased to exist.
They are, as a race, the most ignorant, the most remorseless, and the rudest of barbarians.
The history of Africa, from the most remote ages, has been one of conquest.
There are, therefore, no aboriginal owners to restrain the hand of the taker, or lay bona fide claims to compensation for land seized.
It has been, in the past, ruthlessly torn from the weak by the strong, and held only by force of arms.
Humanitarians, therefore, cannot urge the claims of the Kaffirs over the white conquerors.
From a humanitarian point of view, the race that has proved most worthy of advancing humanity and civilisation has the best of all possible rights to this open country.
For the sake of future races, it is only one of the great existing nations that dare take up this grave responsibility.
Neither Germany, France, nor Russia, so far as their colonial policy and history is concerned, have shown that they are adapted for this great work.
England only has proved that she is equal to the task, as long ago, Imperial Rome did in a lesser way.
Our great empire liberates and advances every land which she protects.
She frees the slave, educates the savage, and makes the black man equal with the white.
She welcomes the stranger within her gates, asks no tyrannical pledges from the Uitlander before she gives him employment and all the rights of her own children.
She embraces all humanity as her children, without shackling them with conditions, either individually or tribal.
Whatever king or chief they owe allegiance to--whatever flag they honour--makes, no difference to their rights as colonists and citizens while they live under and claim the protection of the British flag.
This is our best defence for our right to extend and hold our empire in the face of envious enemies and internal traitors.
What we give up, or lose, or forego is a distinct loss to civilisation, progression, and humanity.
We are the only holders and dispensers of liberty.
The German makes a good colonist under British control; so do the French, the Dutch, and many of the other clans on the earth's surface.
But when Germany seizes a land she treats it as the warlike Kaffirs did.
She butchers the original owners, and insists on all outsiders relinquishing their private rights, and becoming subjects.
As the Kaiser has truly said, "On whatever land the German Eagle fixes its talons, that land is German."
This means, it is no longer free, only a German is entitled to civil rights.
The Boer, wherever he has possessed any authority, has pursued a similar policy, only, being more medieval and ignorantly conservative in his ideas, he goes many steps further in his candid tyranny than does his friend the German.
His religion is a blending of gross superstition, narrowness, intolerance, and Judaism in its most relentless and savage aspect.
He honestly believes in the justice of the curse of Ham; but he believes more, for, like the Moslem with his women, he says that the dark races of the earth are like the beasts, soulless; whom to shoot down is no murder; whom to enslave is his right, as one of the masterful and heaven-favoured races.
He believes in revenge and hatred as sacred duties.
"An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth," are words which he gloats upon.
According to the patriarchal laws he is a good husband and father, and will fight for his own like any red Indian.
Like all savages, however, he does not care for fighting in the open.
He prefers to skulk behind rocks, and take his enemy at a disadvantage.
He is a mass of gross superstition; in this he even surpasses the Kaffir.
He believes fervently in ghosts and omens, and dreads the dark with trembling horror.
He is utterly devoid of chivalry, truth, or common honesty.
A pledge in his estimation means only an expedient to hoodwink his adversary and gain time.
He will make a promise at any time, and break it without the slightest scruple.
He laughs at those who trust him, as fools.
Like the wild boar, he hates to see his lair disturbed.
He would much rather trek than live where civilisation is.
He is rude, uncouth, and pre-eminently inhospitable, and prefers his own ignorance and superstition to enlightenment.
By nature he is a morose and uncompromising savage who has no place among civilised races, and not the faintest conception of democracy.
His greed is sateless; his audacity boundless; and his sense of gratitude nil.
Philanthropy and mercy are qualities which he despises, because he cannot understand them.
He professes to believe in the Redeemer of mankind, but he draws his inspirations from the passages of Scripture that suit his peculiar temperament, and the ethics of Christianity do not.
As a nation, he is as utterly impossible as the Turk, therefore is completely out of place in the Transvaal.
The past history of the Boers in Africa has proved this beyond dispute.
They have slaughtered mercilessly, and oppressed their neighbours wherever they have settled.
It is only by the strong hand that they have been kept so far within bounds.
Their principal grievance against us is that we freed their slaves, and they nurse this grievance with undying hatred.
They have murdered our settlers ruthlessly, betrayed our statesmen, and mocked us for our weaknesses.
They remember their supposed wrongs, and lose no chance of repaying them by brutality and treachery, and mock at our generosity in forgetting what they have done.
the gallant sons we have lost through trusting those ruthless murderers!
England may forget, but what of the mothers, wives, sisters, fathers, and brothers of those who lie buried, and yet unavenged?
It is possible to pardon a brave enemy who has fought fairly.
As Englishmen, we do this always--but only after we have wiped out the blot.
But what true Englishman could forgive the bloody assassin who walks about boasting over his crime?
What true Englishman could sit down tamely, and swallow insult and slavery, as well as murder?
These were the inhuman, hating, and ferocious enemies which some Englishmen delighted to honour, sympathise with, and admire, for their treatment of those Englishmen who had saved their Republic from ruin, and poured wealth into their rapacious pockets.
The tactics of their obstinate and superstitious president is world known.
His shamelessness, greed, craft, and unblushing falsehood, his open enmity, his avarice, and dense stupidity, all these qualities are representative of his people, and what we are asked to admire and sympathise with.
Standing as we do afar off, we are apt to forget the atrocious side of the Boer, and regard the ridiculous side with good-natured contempt.
But to those in the midst of it all, it was by no means a matter to laugh at.
The constant reminders of those atrocities and disgraces, the wanton insults, the brutal treatment, the persistent turning round of the screw, without a moment of relaxation, were maddening even to the meekest and most long-suffering.
As we have already shown, our heroes did not come of a mute and lowly race.
They had British blood in their veins--young English blood that was quickly heated.
Since their coming to the Transvaal this blood had been at boiling pitch.
They tried to hearken to the words of prudence as preached by Philip Martin and Mr Raybold.
They tried to obey their leaders, and shut their eyes to the daily outrages of justice which they beheld, and act in away which their hearts told them was base cowardice.
They saw ladies hustled rudely by rough and armed clowns from the footpath amongst the mud.
They listened to coarse epithets shouted at their countrywomen if they looked indignant at this usage, and did their best to keep their hands in their pockets and their eyes on the ground.
They saw the German mercenaries knock down, kick, and baton the citizens without the slightest provocation, and the citizens take their unmerited punishment without remonstrance, knowing full well there was no possible redress from the Boer authorities.
They saw Boers spit on the beards of Englishmen, and they only take out and use their handkerchiefs to wipe the hateful stains away.
They saw children ill-treated because their parents were English, and the parents lift up their children and soothe them, without attempting to punish the wretches who had made those innocents weep.
They saw all this and grosser outrages constantly being enacted under their eyes, and while they looked they ground their teeth, and wondered how long they would be able to endure this horrible restraint upon their pent-up feelings.
"It will be our turn before long to be batoned," remarked Fred, quietly.
"We cannot expect to be allowed to walk the streets much longer without being molested."
"The Boer or German who attempts to lay a finger on me had better look out.
I'll leave my mark on him," replied Ned, grimly.
"We'll be there at the same time with our signatures," put in Clarence, cheerfully.
Fred was right in his prognostications of evil.
Their independent bearing had already been remarked upon by the police, and their turn came sooner even than they expected.
One morning they had come into town, to have their customary promenade, listen to the latest news, and keep their blood flowing by watching the sights.
Like Paddy, they were trying how much they could stand of this music, and vainly hoping to get used to it by constant habit.
The city had been more than usually in a ferment during the past week.
It had been the election week, and although none of the Johannesburghers had much hope of a change, yet until the affair was decided, there had been a good deal of wordy speculation.
However, as even the most credulous feared, Oom Paul Kruger had once more managed to keep his chair, thanks to his simple and direct management.
While he was travelling the country canvassing for votes, the old hypocrite played with his people, as the man who wants to buy an annuity plays with the insurance company.
He did the sick and feeble old man who had only a few months more to live, and appealed to the sympathy of those who were tired of him as a master.
He played this role so perfectly as to deceive even his own intimates.
As for the Uitlanders, he humbugged them so completely that they became jubilant about the nearness of their emancipation.
Even for a little while the news of his return did not depress them overmuch.
This they considered to be a dead certainty, with the ballot boxes in the hands of his supporters.
A rumour had somehow spread, on the day after the announcement of the result, that he was dead.
For one whole hour Johannesburg lost its head, and became intoxicated with joy.
Shareholders bounced inside the chain, while some were even mad enough to wire the happy event to London, where for another hour on the Stock Exchange Paul Kruger gained more popularity than he had ever gained in his life.
they were not long left to this most unseemly joy.
Hardly had they wiped their mouths after drinking to his safe translation to another sphere than the Grand Old Man of Pretoria showed them how dead he was.
He enjoyed giving them surprises, and the one he sprang on them now was the summary dismissal of Chief Justice Kotze, the only Dutchman who was above bribery or coercion.
Now, indeed, he was beginning his fresh tenure without any pretence of wearing gloves.
Whoever dared to oppose his autocratic tyranny, and stand up for any other laws than those which his will dictated, was to be swept out of the way.
At this act of tyranny, worse than any that the Stuarts ever perpetrated, even Philip Martin looked anxious.
"It is the beginning of the end," he said.
"Cecil Rhodes's last message was for us to hold on and lie low.
How much longer will we be allowed to do this?"
Kotze protested against this unlawful outrage, and refused to accept his dismissal.
But he gained no more by that than the Uitlanders had done.
The inhabitants of Johannesburg were struck dumb when they heard of this scandal, coupled with the tidings that the president's late illness had been all shammed.
Even the Boers themselves were staggered, as this touched their rights as much as it demolished all safety for the Uitlanders.
Throughout Africa a wave of expectant horror passed.
What would this hoary tyrant not do next, now that he had demolished the law?
He was supreme.
Anarchy and massacre would possibly be the next order of the day.
Once again, as in the time of the Jameson Raid, men began to send away their wives and children, and prepare themselves for the inevitable.
On the morning that our heroes took their walk, they found the streets and between the chains blocked with people.
But no business was being done, neither did men venture to speak to each other.
Every one suspected his fellow to be a spy.
Business was at a complete stand, and they watched the Zarps hustling the pedestrians about, and inwardly speculated when the Krupp guns would begin their devastating work.
Anything might be expected now from Pretoria.
With that first act Kruger had pitched the gauntlet straight in the face of England.
Surely he must have already completed his arrangements with Germany.
Halfway down the street the young men met Philip Martin.
He was no longer looking so anxious as he had been the past few days.
He stopped for a moment and whispered to Ned.
"Hold yourselves in readiness to leave for Rhodesia tomorrow.
I shall have a message for you to carry."
"Oh," replied Ned, a little disappointed.
"Must we clear out before the fun begins?"
"Don't be afraid.
Nothing will take place here yet awhile.
This present buster will blow over.
I have just had a bit of news which will make the old gentleman draw in his horns for a bit."
"That's all right," answered Ned, laughing.
Philip Martin had only turned his back on them when four Zarps, who had been watching them, came forward, scattering the people to right and left.
Their batons were drawn, and their purpose unmistakable.
Doom had come upon our heroes.
"Look out, boys!"
cried Ned, as he sprang to the nearest wall, and planted his back against it.
As he did so, he saw amongst the onlookers Stephanus Groblaar.
Fred and Clarence ranged themselves alongside of their chum with alacrity.
"Now, then, come along, you white-livered Uitlanders!"
cried the Zarps, closing in and raising their batons.
"Go with them quietly," shouted the onlookers, warningly, as they saw the boys were preparing to resist.
Philip Martin had by this time rounded the corner, without seeing what had happened.
"Yes; take your licking like true Englishmen!"
cried Stephanus, mockingly.
"Don't be afraid--we shall!"
answered Ned, casting prudence to the winds, as he darted to one side to avoid the falling baton.
It grazed his shoulder, while his aggressor stumbled forward with an ugly oath.
Next moment he was sprawling on his back, with a mouth filled with loose teeth and gore, while Ned caught the baton adroitly as it flew from his grasp.
As he caught it, he swung it round and landed it with crushing force on the jaws of the second officer.
A sound of breaking bones was heard, while the Boer went down like a felled ox.
"Hurrah, boys!
shouted Ned, leaping in to help his chums.
Clarence had been struck, and was lying also on the ground.
But Fred Weldon was giving a good account of himself, dodging the baton of the Boer--an immense fellow--and getting in some facers, which made the baton strokes uncertain.
With a strong tap on the back of the Boer's cranium, which was bare, Ned quickly sent him alongside of his two mates.
Then for a moment the fray was over, for the remaining policeman had rushed to the outside of the ring, and was blowing his whistle for help.
cried the crowd, opening a lane for them, although otherwise they did not offer to help.
"No, you don't," cried Stephanus, covering the two boys with his revolver.
"Move a foot and I'll riddle you."
Ned looked down at poor Clarence, who was lying senseless on the ground, and decided that the game was up.
He therefore glanced towards Stephanus and cried with a scornful laugh--  "I won't run away, Stephanus Groblaar, and you may have this useless baton."
As he uttered the words he pitched the baton full at his enemy.
Stephanus fired as the baton left Ned's hand, while he ducked.
Where the head of Ned had been the bullet struck the wall and knocked a piece of stone out.
But Stephanus had no time to fire again or evade the baton.
Full in the face it struck him, and down he also went.
A faint cheer broke from some of the onlookers, while they turned and scattered, leaving the victims to their fate.
The Zarps were coming in force.
Ned saw them coming, and, jumping over to Stephanus, he plucked the smoking revolver from his grasp, and quickly returned to the wall.
"We're in for it now, Fred.
I guess we'll be hanged for this morning's work."
"What's the odds?"
replied Fred.
"We've shown them that English men are not curs."
"Stand back, you fellows, or I'll pot some of you.
We surrender, only let us go gently."
grunted the Boers, as they looked round them at the carnage.
"Throw aside your shooter.
We won't hurt you and spoil the gallows."
Ned flung down the revolver, while some of the police went for stretchers.
The others contented themselves with closing round.
Seeing that they did not offer to molest them, the boys knelt down to look after Clarence.
He had been hit over the head and stunned, but was now recovering.
As they lifted him up he opened his eyes and groaned.
Then he struggled up and looked round him, somewhat confused, for a second or two.
Is it all over?"
"Yes, Clar," replied Ned.
"All over, for the present.
The next scene will be prison.
Can you walk?"
"I'd rather say so," replied Clarence, rubbing his skull gently.
but that was a clinker I got.
It has made a new bump as big as an ostrich egg.
Ah yes, I can waltz along with you two."
To the surprise of our heroes, their captors treated them quite gently on their way to jail.
They merely held them firmly by the arms, and did not attempt either to kick or jerk them about, as was generally done with prisoners.
Behind them came the stretchers with the wounded men who lay inertly, and after them followed a numerous crowd.
The men kept silence, but the women waved their handkerchiefs and cheered.
Ned, Fred, and Clarence had won popularity.
Even the Boers treated them with grim respect, and said--  "These pups can bite as well as bark.
Ugh, it's a pity they are not Boers."
About a couple of hours after their incarceration they received a visit from Mr Raybold.
He had come as soon as he heard about the affair, and although he looked very grave, yet he did not reproach them.
"I expected something like this from you young blades; but it is a serious scrape for all that."
"Any of them killed?"
asked Ned, coolly.
"No, not quite so bad.
You have broken one man's jaw, and spoilt the nose of young Groblaar.
The other two are not much the worse, only they'll make the most of their bruises."
"I suppose so; when they make such an outcry over the couple of men they lost at Krugersdorp.
What do you think will be done to us?"
"You'll be sent on to Pretoria first place.
But what will happen next, no one can foretell.
They may sentence you to death, or hard labour for life.
I hope I may be able to get you off with a heavy fine, as the Boers love cash almost as much as they do revenge.
What were you doing when they set upon you?"
"Absolutely nothing," replied Ned.
"We had just parted with Mr Martin, and were about to move on, when four big scoundrels pounced upon us."
"That will not matter," replied Mr Raybold, dolefully.
"Oom Paul has denied any hearing or trial for Chief Justice Kotze.
He charged him with maladministration of justice, and swore in the Volksraad that he was a liar.
When they can treat their own judges in this fashion, they are capable of hatching up any charge against you.
However, we shall not have long to wait before we know."
"I hope you won't pay any fines for us, sir," said Ned.
"I am sure we would all rather go to hard labour, or whatever else they like to sentence us to."
"We shall see," returned Mr Raybold, shaking his head sadly.
"I wish this day had passed in peace, for tomorrow you would have been out of this tyrant's clutches."
"We are sorry also in one way, but our resistance has not made much difference.
I fancy Stephanus Groblaar has got up some story about us.
I had a quarrel with him out on the veldt, and for some reason he seems to bear me ill-will."
tell me about that?"
said Mr Raybold, quickly.
Ned told him about the fight, and the words he had used on that occasion.
"This is bad--very bad.
They sentenced a man the other day to two years' hard labour for merely shouting on the Rand, `Nobody gets justice in this country.'
What that fine speech of yours may cost us, with the additions which this young Groblaar may put to it, it is hard to say.
Never mind.
Keep up your courage, lads.
Your friends will not leave you undefended; and we are all mighty proud of you for your pluck."
Clarence took leave of his father very tenderly, while the others received warm hand-grasps.
Then the Rand capitalist left them a good deal comforted by the interview.
They did not know, but to be able to see them at all had cost Mr Raybold a tidy sum in the way of palm-oiling.
Like the Eastern prisons, as in every other department of this Republican Government, corruption ran very high, from the President to the meanest official.
On the following morning they were examined, and charged with a whole list of offences; then, after this preliminary farce was over, they were handcuffed and taken, closely guarded, to Pretoria to be tried.
Although our heroes had been brought up amidst the comforts and refinements of better-class English life, they were not fastidious.
Their recent overland experience among the burgher farmers had taken a good deal of the fine edge off their susceptibilities as to eating, drinking, and lodgment.
It had also opened their eyes considerably as to the inconsistency of humanity.
Those bare, dirty, and barn-like homesteads which satisfied the Boers generation after generation, and compared to which many of the huts of the Kaffirs were fragrant--the cow-dung and blood-blended plaster and flooring--were, to say the least, peculiar in their aroma to the nostrils of strangers.
Added to this, the strong flavour of the Boer tobacco, with which those dens reeked, rendered the atmosphere more powerful than pleasant to any except a Boer family.
To them, however, it smelt home-like and grateful.
Outside, the approaches to a Boer farm were kept in a state of absolute and traditional disregard to all sanitary laws.
The refuse and decay teemed with disease and abomination.
No wanderer required a candle in the window to light them to these abodes of the dopper.
Their olfactory organs would have been quick enough, even while suffering under the most virulent cold, for at least half a league distant.
Wherever the Boer settled, that part of the veldt became a pigsty.
Our heroes had experienced all this, and become case-hardened against unholy perfumes and disgusting sights.
Their digestive organs had also become used to the tough biltong, vile coffee, and unvaried nightly stews.
Thus they were able to stand a good deal of dirt and discomfort without noticing details.
They had also gained a considerable insight of the Boers' other peculiarities.
Their utter lack of humour and sullen stolidity; their merciless barbarity to their servants and cattle, joined to their stern and one-sided religious fervour.
The Bible, the cowhide, and the rifle were always kept handy for constant use by those pious dopper farmers.
The word of God for themselves and families.
The cowhide for their cattle and servants, and the rifle where the cowhide failed to convince.
They had seen these farmers flog the Kaffirs within an inch of their lives for the slightest offence, or perhaps because the master was in a bad temper, and the Kaffir chanced to be in his road.
They had seen them bring out their guns, if the braced-up and lacerated natives looked nasty, and deliberately shoot them dead, then go indoors immediately after, read their Bibles, sing their psalms, and thank the Lord of hosts for giving them grace.
Their infernal cruelties never touched their consciences in the slightest degree, and they had no fear of the laws of the land condemning them.
Each Boer made his own laws, and these were merciless.
There was no justice for the native; he was a beast to be down-trodden and enslaved.
His land and his life were theirs, the chosen people of the Lord, to abuse or murder as they pleased.
Yet they never neglected family worship.
Nor would they permit the stranger to go from them without reading a chapter, and delivering themselves of an unctuous prayer.
Sylvan life amongst the pious doppers was very unlovely and revolting.
Having already experienced so much, the young men hardly noticed the filthy and disgraceful conditions of the Johannesburg tronk, or jail.
That they were crammed into a small cell of ten by twenty feet, along with twenty-five other prisoners, was nasty; yet they endured this fate with as much philosophy as they could.
Twenty-eight prisoners, waiting their trial, were immured in this suffocating, dark, and noisome den, which could be compared with nothing else than the hold of a slaver, or the black hole of Calcutta.
A third of these were Kaffir women, and the majority of the rest, the vilest and most foul-mouthed scum in Johannesburg.
There was no separation of the sexes; they were all crushed together, regardless of their ages or offences.
The atmosphere was horrible, for there was no other ventilation than what the opening of the door gave.
It was opened occasionally by the warders as they thought fit, to give the captives a little air and prevent suffocation.
The floors were cemented, and the roof of corrugated iron; but as water is a luxury in Johannesburg, and the Boers are averse to washing and also are regardless of dirt, weeks if not months had passed since last the accumulations had been shovelled out.
The mind of an Englishman at home could not conjure up any idea approaching this abomination of stench and overpowering heat.
Here our heroes had spent their first night of Boer prison life, listening, or rather trying to shut their ears, to the groans, curses, and obscenities of their fellow-captives.
Packed closely together, they were forced to stand still and upright, with the perspiration pouring from them, and swallow the poison that entered their lungs instead of air.
Many--indeed, most--of these prisoners had broken heads and other wounds, and these, clotted and untended, added to the disgusting horrors.
When morning came, and they were hustled into the Pretoria train, they felt almost half dead.
Faint and breathless, they gasped as they were dragged into the court, and listened to the charges with dull apathy.
There was little enough fight in them now.
By the time they reached Pretoria, however, their young constitutions, aided by the fresh veldt air, had restored both their appetites and their courage.
In spite of their jailors' grunts of disapproval, they were laughing and jesting more from bravado than through good spirits.
"We must show them we are game, no matter what happens to us," said Ned; and his chums' loyalty backed him up.
In the same train, but in a different compartment, Stephanus Groblaar and the wounded and battered Zarps travelled to give their evidence.
The boys caught a glimpse of Stephanus as he got out, and could not help enjoying the sight.
The baton had smashed the bridge of his nose and spoilt what little beauty he possessed.
He was marked for life, so that they would recognise him under any disguise almost.
They caught his one eye glaring luridly on Ned, for the other was bandaged up, and they grinned broadly as they were pushed past.
They were marched along to the tronk, getting hasty glimpses of the Dopper Kirk, where Oom Paul sometimes preaches; the frowning forts and warlike batteries which he has erected at so much expense to his insolvent government, as a sign of the friendly disposition of the Volksraad towards the Uitlander, and the open gallows and stocks, which also were tokens of the social advancement of the constitution.
That church obstructing the traffic was typical of the people's wisdom and foresight, as their town lying in the swamp was.
They doted on mud and pestilential swamps, as they piously believed in obstruction, dirt, bad drainage, and public executions.
The Pretoria tronk--at least, the part into which our heroes were locked--was a shade more endurable than had been their lodging of the night before.
Morality, if not sanitary arrangements, was slightly more observed.
Their cell, which was the same size as the last, was not quite so crowded, and they had white companions only, and of their own sex.
Between them and the Kaffirs was a sheet of corrugated iron.
Small holes were bored in the sheet-iron walls; these were, however, close to the roof, and did not give them much fresh air.
During the day the heat was intense, as the thin iron became almost red-hot under the sun-glare.
At night it was in proportion cold.
There had been thirty-five prisoners in this cell two days before, but eighteen of these had been removed; thus they had only seventeen companions waiting their sentences.
Fortunately, also, the majority of these prisoners were respectable citizens, whose crimes were as yet to be invented.
Like our heroes, they had been seized upon without any pretext, without being aware yet of the charges.
They would learn all that at the time appointed by their tyrants.
Small straw mattresses were given to them to sleep on at nights; these were placed side by side along the walls, leaving a narrow gangway between.
These mattresses had served hundreds of prisoners before them; they were dirty in the extreme, worn by holes, and infested by other inhabitants beside themselves, that not only did not sleep when darkness fell, but did their best to murder sleep.
A Salvation Army night-shelter might be as lively, but it could not be worse than were those unhallowed beds.
They were placed upon the ground, and each morning were taken out and aired in the exercise-yard.
Otherwise the cells were devoid of furniture.
There were neither seats nor tables.
All that afternoon the prisoners sat looking on the ground, as far away from the heated walls as they could get.
As they had come in time for dinner, they got a basin of thin soup with some hard meat and black bread.
This they devoured eagerly.
At four o'clock they had a supper of mealie with salt and water.
Then their beds were brought in, and they prepared to enjoy themselves.
They were able to breathe; that was the sole comfort of that shivering night.
Being dog-tired with their previous night's vigil, in spite of the tormentors that bit and stung them incessantly, our heroes soon fell asleep and forgot their miseries.
In the morning at seven o'clock they got another dose of mealie-porridge and salt with water.
Then they were allowed to go and wash themselves in the muddy streams that ran through the yard.
All the prisoners were turned out to the yard at the same time.
Kaffirs, Malays, and whites, thieves, murderers, and political prisoners, they were all mixed up like their mattresses, and permitted to wash their clothes and themselves in the same muddy stream together.
On this day they were allowed to stay in the yard until five o'clock, and as it was about one hundred and fifty feet, they were able to take good exercise and have fresh air.
They were not long before they began to play leap-frog and some other games, including a wrestling match between Ned and Fred, which was watched with keen interest by the other prisoners.
At about half-past two they were pleasantly surprised by a visit from Philip Martin, who brought with him a Pretoria solicitor.
Both listened to the story of their arrest, and the lawyer took notes, after which Philip said--  "I think we shall manage to square the Zarps, so that they will let you off mildly.
The man with the broken jaw we must give a golden plaster to; but your most bitter witness will be Stephanus Groblaar.
He will have his knife into you, and swear anything against you.
His father is a personal friend and tool of the president."
That night they did not sleep so well; on the whole, it was the most uncomfortable time they had ever experienced.
They were glad when daylight came and the doors opened to let them out.
They were first in the yard, and took advantage to be the first in the stream before it was stirred up.
After their bath they once more felt ready to laugh at their discomforts and woes.
They had hardly supped their porridge, when a couple of German policemen came and marched them off solemnly.
Outside the tronk half a dozen more stiff and wooden-looking bodyguards were drawn up, armed to the teeth with rifles, swords, and revolvers.
They closed in upon our heroes without a word, merely pointing to the front as their way to march.
Ned, Fred, and Clarence drew themselves up with dignity, seeing that no attempt was made to handcuff them, and dusting their clothes with their handkerchiefs, stepped out proudly in the middle of their formidable escort.
Handcuffs sadly spoil the effect of dignity.
They make a prisoner look too pathetic.
"I wonder where these Noah's Ark Johnnies are taking us to?"
"To the court to be tried, I expect," answered Fred.
"No," said Clarence.
"There is some other game going on with us.
Don't you see these are not the ordinary Boer bobbies?
They are the president's own bodyguards."
so they are.
Perhaps old Kruger is going to interview us.
I hope so, for I'd like to see the grand old humbug."
These fellows are sure to understand English.
All Germans do who leave their own country."
If they did understand what Ned had so rashly said, they showed no sign.
All emotion seemed to have been drilled out of their big faces, as all free action had been drilled out of their tall figures.
Solemnly they marched to the word of command with heads jerked up and immovable eyes.
Right, left, right, left, they planted their feet as one man, without making a single wrinkle in their coats.
They were for all the world exactly like exaggerated German metal soldiers set working by mechanism, and newly painted.
Down through the centre of Church Street they marched, the automatic movements of the guards so infecting our heroes that they unconsciously fell into the same step after a few paces.
Then only one distinct tramp could be heard, as each left or right foot crushed upon the ground.
The people on the side paths watched them going along curiously.
Past the grand Government buildings, with that disputed statue to Liberty on its centre tower, they strode.
The enlightened burghers greatly object to this statue, as they don't believe in a woman representing freedom, and think it must either mean Her Britannic Majesty or the Virgin Mary, both highly objectionable personages in a dopper's eye.
On they marched, until they reached the western end of the street, where a verandahed house stood with tall trees in front of it, and on each side of the gate a helmeted police-soldier.
Then they knew where they were coming to, and felt a tremor pass over them.
They were approaching the kraal of the savage and crafty tyrant chief of the Transvaal, Kruger.
It was a respectable and fair-sized house of the ordinary colonial fashion, with a broad covered verandah in front, and fine shady trees inside the rails--a comfortable and homely place, with nothing special about it to denote the character or position of its owner, except those two heavily armed sentinels at the gate.
Yet our heroes shivered slightly at the thought of the coming interview, and wished they could have put it off.
They were not frightened physically of this avowed and relentless enemy of their countrymen.
Whatever he might sentence them to, they were prepared to meet and endure bravely.
It was his craft that they dreaded, lest he should by some devilish artifice lure them into a trap, and so get something out of them which would hurt their friends.
They were frightened of themselves, not of this wily and ferocious Boer of Boers.
They were going to be sounded by the man who had been able to deceive and outwit the smartest British diplomatists, and instinctively they felt how powerless they would be in his hands.
That they were taken before him, prior to their examination by the landdrost, was a sign that he suspected them of being in the possession of some secret, which he would do his best to worm out of them.
His scowls and threats they could defy, but his preternatural cunning they trembled to think about.
"Courage, boys, and caution," whispered Ned, as they paused for a moment outside the gate.
"Let me conduct the palaver as much as possible with this ponderous Machiavelli."
"Right you are, Ned," answered his chum in awestruck tones.
"I wish we were safe back in the tronk, though."
Kruger, the man who could spoof Great Britain, and drive his own people like a flock of sheep, appeared, before they saw him in their imagination, to be almost as colossal a character as their ideal hero, Cecil Rhodes.
Throughout Africa these two giants stood facing each other, while the rest of the world watched and waited the result of their deadly duel.
Kruger, the champion of everything that was despicable, oppressive, and false; Rhodes, the champion of chivalry, humanity, and progress.
Kruger had won his past triumphs by treachery and unscrupulous steadfastness.
He stood like a rock, defying reform.
Rhodes also was another rock, guarding the lands outside this camp of treason.
Kruger had been able to humbug the Imperial Government, and get what he wanted from them easily; but he could not humbug this sleepless and powerful watcher.
Kruger had his agents and spies everywhere; so also had Rhodes.
He was fighting this Boer with his own weapons.
Kruger was rich, but he liked to hoard his capital, and get as much as he could for nothing or by promises.
Cecil Rhodes spent his wealth lavishly.
Kruger was working for his own hand, and with the malignant purpose of weakening his enemy and causing discord amongst the nations.
Rhodes had devoted his life and his wealth for his country's welfare, and for the security of Africa.
The one was a tyrant of the worst order; the other was inspired by the purest and most disinterested patriotism.
The one was distrusted and disliked generally all round, even by a large section of his subjects; the other was universally respected and loved for his courage, brain-power, and unimpeachable honesty.
Our heroes had seen for a few moments the first champion of civilisation; they were now about to look upon his antagonist, the impious father of lies.
There was an air of stillness and depression about the place, which these two immovable policemen accentuated.
The shady verandah looked dark almost in contrast with the blazing brightness outside.
As the boys looked under the branches, the idea occurred to them that they were about to enter the web of a gigantic human spider.
They could get in easy enough, but how would they come out?
They were not, however, kept long waiting at the gate.
Their guards stopped suddenly, grounded their rifles; then, while the two gatekeepers saluted, they were pushed forward and entered the shadows.
In another moment they were ushered, without ceremony, into the presence of the master.
It was a large reception-room in which Kruger sat, with a wide stretch between the door and the table at his side.
On the table were placed a huge silver tobacco-box, a large clasp Bible, and what the young men noted more particularly, the small "three ace" watch-guard tokens which had been taken from them with their other effects.
There were also a few papers placed handy for, the president to reach.
He sat in a big, crimson-covered armchair, with a spittoon at his feet, and his pipe in his mouth.
Behind him, on the wall, they saw through the tobacco mist a large and harshly painted oil portrait of himself.
The room was smelling like a tap-room, while clouds of rank tobacco reek floated densely overhead.
Yet that portrait riveted their eyes, and forced them to look at it before even the original could command their attention--it was such an exaggerated and hideous reproduction of all his worst points.
It was also so crudely and vilely painted that it seemed like a gross caricature.
Indeed, it was hardly human, but rather as if it had been an imaginative attempt on the part of a house-painter, to depict a gorilla-like, semi-humanised monster.
A large red face, with swollen heavy features; narrow, bestial forehead; small, crafty, and sullen eyes, with a baboon-like fringe of white-grey hair running from the large flapping ears to below the heavy chin.
The lips were shapeless, yet relentless in their downward curve.
A strange guttural and gurgling sound growled out, and drew their wondering looks from the portrait to the man himself.
President Kruger was speaking; at least, they supposed that loud and deep mouthful of explosive gutturals and gurglings was his mode of expressing himself.
It must have been an order, for as they glanced round, they noticed the guards quitting the apartment, and found themselves alone with the monster and his secretary or interpreter.
He was looking at them from under his sullen, pent brows, with ice-cold, piggish eyes that made them shiver again in spite of their efforts to appear brave.
He was so horribly ugly, so revoltingly animal-like, and so utterly unsympathetic, that they instinctively recoiled before him.
He grinned ogreishly as he observed this step backward, and taking his pipe in his huge, hairless, flabby hand, he puffed out a volume of smoke and expectorated loudly into the spittoon.
Then he resumed his pipe, and leaned back in his chair, still watching them intently.
He had awed them, and he was evidently delighted with the effect which he had produced, for he chuckled hoarsely as he sent out another huge volume of smoke from his wide mouth.
That grim chuckle, with the undertaker-like costume and vulgar deportment of the animal, undid the first effect of his savage glare.
The boys looked again, and saw only an unmannerly, brutal, and hog-like old man, with the ugliest face they had ever seen; with elephantine proportions and shapeless great feet, filling out a gimcrack crimson chair, while his fat, coarse hands gripped the sides.
His portrait had not flattered him, yet it was distinctly like him, with all its artistic faults.
The narrowness and dense ignorance were all there in both picture and sitter, so also the intolerance, obstinacy, and brutality painfully pronounced with his greed, cunning, and plebeian meanness.
He was the same sort of Boer as those that they had seen on the farms ill-treating their servants and cattle, the same superstitious and rude dopper who read his Bible and doggedly shut out charity from his heart.
All the rudeness, filthy habits, and moroseness of his race were here in unbending and irredeemable force, carved and cemented by age and habit into the hardness of cast iron.
They were no longer appalled by his ugliness; instead, they were looking at him with undisguised loathing and contempt.
Was this the man who had hoodwinked men of intellect--this low-bred, stupid, and surly beast, whose only qualities were vindictive hatred and ignorant, stupid conceit and arrogance?
Surely he could deceive no one who stood face to face with him, for that countenance was an open index of all the mean vices which make men abhorred and despised?
He looked and acted as if his proper place was amongst hod-carriers, not politicians.
They had hit upon the keynote of his dangerous power in their misplaced contempt.
It was this appearance of stupidity that threw keen men off their guard when dealing with him--this and his hypocritical cant.
He looked no more intellectual than an ignorant local preacher, and as he was constantly preaching, they forgot to look under his words.
Behind all these state platitudes, and copy-book texts, he plotted with the cunning and ferocity of a relentless savage.
After watching them for full five minutes with half-shut eyes, while he puffed like a steam-engine at his pipe, he made a motion with one blunt forefinger towards the table.
His attendant at once rose and handed him the tobacco-box.
This was not what he wanted; still, while it was there, he filled his pipe and lit it afresh.
Then he beckoned again.
This time the secretary handed him one of the ace trinkets.
He took it in the palm of his paw, and regarded it with suspicious eyes; then the lips widened and the cheeks bulged out, while another mouthful of harsh sounds were belched forth.
The secretary explained this jumble of gutturals to our heroes.
"Why do you wear this badge?
What does it signify?"
Ned explained that it was the badge of a club in Johannesburg, of which he and his companions were members.
The president broke out as soon as he had spoken, and the secretary went on with his questions.
"We know that well enough; but how came you strangers to be members of this club?"
Ned answered because they wished it.
There was no law against Englishmen joining it at once on their arrival.
"Take care, younker, and remember where you are.
Answer questions, but don't make remarks.
How many members are there?"
"I don't know."
"What is the object of this club?
Take care how you answer.
We know already that its object is against the State."
"Then it is more than I do," answered Ned, boldly.
"What is done there?"
"Magazine and newspaper reading and letter-writing.
Some of the members smoke, some play dominoes, but not often."
"And this design--what does it mean?"
"The ace of hearts, the ace of spades, and the ace of diamonds."
"That's all."
"Why not the ace of clubs as well?"
I don't think the citizens of Johannesburg have got that ace," answered Ned, innocently.
A chuckle came from the armchair.
Then President Kruger for the first time spoke in very fair English--the tongue he understood perfectly but hated so viciously.
As he spoke he smiled a fat wrinkly smile that gave his face a simple and grotesque expression of good humour.
His voice was thick and rumbling.
"You are a slim carl for your age, younker.
How old are you?"
"Eighteen," replied Ned.
"And you, my young brakjes?"
Not knowing that "brakje" was a term of contempt, they answered freely enough.
Again Kruger chuckled, while he shook his ponderous head and pointed his clumsy finger at them.
"Far too young to be mixed up in conspiracy and treason.
Young gentlemen like you ought to stay in your own country, and not come here breaking the laws and making riots."
"We have done nothing, your Excellency," said Ned.
"Do you call it nothing to knock down four honest burghers, smash the nose of one and the jawbone of another?
Do you call it nothing to threaten my police with a revolver, and use the insolent language you have done?"
He had risen to his feet by this time, pulled himself out of the chair ponderously and by degrees.
As he stood now towering above them like a hippopotamus, he impressed them with his physical strength.
His eyes were beginning to lighten up dangerously.
"I have you in the hollow of my hand, you miserable brakjes, as I hold every dog in my country.
What you have so foolishly spoken entitles you to hard labour for some years.
The assault you committed on the authorities is punishable by death.
Do you think I can allow my men to be injured in this way by boys--eh?"
"We were only defending ourselves.
They struck at us first and without the slightest cause."
"It is a verodomde lie.
You belong to a nation of liars and vipers, allermachtij!"
shouted Kruger, savagely, an ominous gurgle coming from his throat, while his right arm began to swing as if about to strike them, and his eyes became buried under the flesh of his upper lids.
Ned bit his lips and remained silently facing this ogre, with flashing looks.
gurgled the president, controlling his rising temper as suddenly as it had been raised.
"I can do all this to you, and no one dare stop me, not even your queen," he added childishly.
"I am master here, and what I will is fate.
I can send you to my worst prison, where you will rot all your miserable days.
But I can also be kind and merciful to those who deserve my clemency.
Now, if you will be good younkers and tell me all that you know, I shall pardon you, and never send you for trial at all--nay, more, I'll give you each a nice billet, where you can serve the Republic and make your fortune.
Now, are you going to be good younkers and give me all your confidence freely, as if I was your father, or your tender-hearted uncle--Oom Paul, you know," he chuckled unctuously--"or must I send you to rot in the tronk?"
"We are English, your Excellency, and sons of the Empire, not Dutch spies and traitors," answered Ned, for his companions, proudly and without a pause.
"Then go and--rot!"
roared Kruger, bringing his big fist down on the table with a bang that made tobacco-box and Bible jump.
"Send these ruffians to the landdrost, and let the law take its course."
The last our heroes saw, for that time, of the humane president of the Republic, was him puffing furiously at his pipe, with his ugly face distorted and his eyes out of sight.
"I guess he doesn't like to be contradicted," said Ned, as the police once more marched them off.
Tender-hearted and magnanimous Uncle Paul had not come best out of this interview, neither had he exhibited much of his vaunted diplomacy and character-reading.
Indeed, he had shown himself to be what he was exactly--a densely stupid and tyrannical Boer, who thought to cow three lads with his threats, and make them his tools by a little clumsy and transparent cajolery.
This was the only method he had, however, of dealing with people, and what his parasites termed his greatness.
His agents and whitewashes have called him a man of deep religious feeling, honesty of purpose, singleness of life, thoroughness of character, free from all vices and defects, of great magnanimity, mercy, clemency, and justice, and possessed of the simplicity of a child.
Yes; he had the simplicity of a very much spoilt, greedy, and vicious child.
Our heroes had penetrated this side of his nature.
They were now about to taste of his clemency and justice.
They had thwarted his intentions concerning them, and, being a Boer, he could not pardon that from either man or child.
No Boer was ever known to forgive or forget any rebuff.
They never reason; they can only brood upon their side of the question and plan revenge.
Kruger showed his thoroughness in the way he pursued them with his witnesses and private orders to the landdrost.
He did this with the thoroughness of a red-skin.
Their advocate was snubbed, and ordered to sit down the moment he rose to defend them.
No witnesses were called on their side, while people they had never seen came and swore to actions and words they had never thought about or said.
Then the verdict was given without a pause, and their sentence delivered with vicious denunciation from the judge.
As they listened to him they were almost persuaded that they were very dangerous criminals, and deserved the gallows, instead of hard labour and long imprisonment.
Boer justices, now that Kotze was removed and they had only one will to consult, did their work with sweeping and drastic force.
They punished not only the criminal, but his friends as well, when they could be got at.
Their sentences were--  Seven years each, with hard labour.
œ2000 fine each, or another five years.
A hundred lashes, to be spread over the first two years in the following order: twenty-five lashes after the first three months' imprisonment, and twenty-five each six months after.
Our heroes laughed at the fines, but they clenched their teeth and vowed that they would be free or dead before the lashes were inflicted upon them.
"If we get free and live, boys," whispered Ned, fiercely, "I hope that fiend Kruger may not die before I can kill him."
Mr Raybold and Philip Martin got a few words with them before they were led away.
"Don't you pay that fine, father," said Clarence.
"Not until you are at liberty, then I don't mind what it costs me," replied his father, brokenly.
"Don't be afraid, father; the Transvaal hasn't got a tronk that will keep us in for three months, now that we know our fate."
Philip stooped and whispered in the ear of Ned.
"We shall move heaven and earth to get you sent to one jail.
After that, day and night we will work to help your escape.
Keep up your pluck, and take advantage of all chances.
We'll have you shadowed with friends and able horses."
Ned smiled, and pressed the hand of his friend as he answered--  "I will not spend all my time sleeping, you bet."
It was a desperate life our heroes led after this day, and might have broken even their spirits, only for the hope they had of accomplishing their escape.
After passing a week at Pretoria, they were sent up the country to Nylstroom, where some heavy road-making was being done.
This they did not object to, as it was so far on the way to Rhodesia.
They were glad also to find that they were not separated.
Here they were treated with all the ignominy and harshness that the stupid and merciless Boers could invent to make their captives sick of existence.
They were put into a cell where only natives were confined, and not allowed any bedding whatever.
If they could find space enough to lie down, that was all the comfort they were permitted to have.
This, of course, was intended to degrade them as far as possible, and doubtless would have been a terrible punishment to a Boer.
But our heroes, being more liberally brought up, did not find the company of those Kaffirs half the infliction that some of their late white companions had been.
The captive savages were cleaner and more wholesome, both outwardly and inwardly.
They were men most of them, whose only crime had been that of conquered enemies.
Tall, powerful warriors they had been once upon a time, with spirits still untamed, and hearts filled with undying hatred toward their harsh oppressors.
As soon as these prisoners discovered that Ned, Fred, and Clarence were English, and filled with the same hatred as they had, they received them into their ranks, and treated them with all the kindness and consideration which they were able to show.
Several of them formed a blood bond with our heroes, which made them allies and friends for life.
One clear benefit in this companionship was that these Kaffirs thus pledged would be faithful to them.
Indeed, amongst the whole gang, there was not likely to be a traitor or a spy.
These poor wretches had nothing to gain by treachery, for their condition would not be a whit improved.
They all knew the Boers from bitter experience, and abhorred them as much as they respected their English conquerors.
By daybreak they were marched out to their work under the escort of an armed and mounted force of warders.
The food served out to them was mealie porridge with salt, and not too much of that.
From the hour our heroes entered Nylstroom, they were constantly in a famishing condition.
Yet they had to labour as navvies all day long under the broiling rays until sundown, with hardly any intermission except the short time allowed for their midday meal.
The overseers rode about abusing them in German and Low Dutch, and plying their cowhide whips over the backs of those who fainted or shirked their work.
It was worse than slavery, as these Boers did not care whether the prisoners lived or died.
If they resented the savage stroke by so much as a look, they were tied up and flogged almost to death.
If they showed fight, they were at once shot down and flung to one side like carrion.
Our heroes could not have endured the whip even with their hopes of liberty buoying them up, therefore they laboured with a will, and gave the brutes no chance of chastising them.
Sometimes the whip cracked over their heads, but fortunately for their future, it did not descend on their backs.
The reason for this was that their friends outside had managed to get at these venal wretches, and paid them a weekly sum to spare the young men that last outrage.
They were all the more closely watched for this very reason so that they might not escape.
During the day this would have been impossible, as before they could have run a dozen steps, they would have been shot down.
They had passed a fortnight of this wretched existence, when, one day, as Ned looked up, he saw a party of horsemen riding past.
Amongst them was Philip Martin, who, catching his eye, pointed quickly north, and then patted his horse.
Ned knew what that meant.
They were to run northward when their chance came, where friends and horses would be in readiness.
His heart bounded as he read the signals and saw his friend gallop past him.
Then he bent and plied his pickaxe with renewed energy.
In spite of their semi-starvation, the hard labour did not hurt our heroes.
Already they had got over the utter exhaustion that made them so helpless when they reached their cells.
They had lost flesh woefully, but their muscles were becoming tough and hard as steel, and their skins tanned and sun-proof.
They did not fear but that they would be able to run once they got the chance.
Their cell was a small one, with corrugated iron on two sides and mud-cemented walls on the other two.
Each night they were carefully searched before being locked in, so that it was impossible for them to smuggle in any tool.
Still, now that Ned had seen help so close at hand, he did not despair.
What he could not get in himself might be sent to him from the outside.
That night he told his chums what he had seen, and their spirits rose wonderfully at the news.
"They will be on the outlook, I am sure, therefore we must let them know whereabouts we are located."
After some consultation the idea struck them to hang out a bit of rag from one of the narrow air-holes.
If they did this that night, it was almost sure to be noticed and understood by those on the watch outside.
There were fifteen Kaffirs in this cell besides themselves who would have to be trusted.
The lads had seen enough of them to risk taking the lot into their confidence.
"Cocoeni," he whispered to a strong young fellow, who had vowed friendship with him, "would you like to escape?"
"You bet, baas," replied the Kaffir, who understood and could speak a little English.
"And the others, will they help us?"
"Yes, baas; you may trust us all.
We shall all help you if you show us how."
"I have friends outside who, when they know where we are, will give us some instrument to break out of this."
And what can we do to let them know?"
Ned had torn a piece from his shirt while he was speaking; he now said--  "Give me a back up, Cocoeni.
I'll push out this bit of rag.
When the moon rises they will see it."
"So will the Boers," said Cocoeni.
"Oh, we must risk that.
If they do wander round that side, they may not think anything about it.
Besides, they are too lazy to do much knocking about at night."
Cocoeni willingly placed his face against the wall, and bent his back while Ned climbed up on to his broad shoulders.
It was pitch dark inside, but they could see the stars through the slits near the roof.
After the rag had been pushed half through so that one end hung outside and the other inside, they agreed to watch and watch turn about.
At the first appearance of day they would take in the signal.
Clarence took the first watch of three hours, while the rest lay down to sleep.
By this time every Kaffir had been told by Cocoeni, and they were prepared to obey orders.
Nothing disturbed Clarence.
The Boers never troubled themselves to visit their prisoners during the night, and doubtless not many bothered themselves to keep awake.
He saw, however, by the rays of silver that the moon had risen and was shining on the outer wall.
It was a full moon, so that the rag must be observed if any one was on the watch.
Fred took the next watch, nor had he anything to report when Ned relieved him.
The moon by this time had moved round to the other side.
Ned waited patiently for about two hours in the darkness, when, just as he was beginning to think there would be no answer that night, Cocoeni touched him, and whispered softly in his ear--  "Baas, some one outside creeping gently."
The keen ears of the savage had heard what Ned could not.
A few moments afterwards something heavy dropped upon his head, and fell with a muffled thud on the clay floor.
He stooped to lift it, and to his delight felt the head of a small pickaxe wrapped in flannel.
As he was unrolling it, another article came through the slit, and this he found to be the handle.
His friends had understood his signal, and this was their reply.
He hugged handle and head in his arms with an ecstasy of delight.
Now, at last, freedom was within sight.
It was too late, however, to do anything this morning.
In another hour dawn would be upon them.
They must defer operations for another night, and hide the treasure.
He explained what he had received to Cocoeni, who woke his friends to tell them, while Ned did the same with Fred and Clarence.
A deep grunt of joy spoke the Kaffirs' feelings, while our heroes fairly danced with pleasure.
To dig a small hole in the corner was the work of the next half-hour, after which they placed the articles side by side and covered them with the clay, which they pressed down, and moistening the top from their water-jug, they smoothed it as carefully over as they could in the dark.
One of the Kaffirs lay down on the damp clay and dried it with his body, while the others crawled about and picked up every portion of loose clay, which they swallowed as they found them.
Before the first streak of dawn crept in the floor was as clear of debris as it had been before, and the part over the pickaxe completely caked and dry.
Then Ned looked up to see and remove the rag.
It was gone.
The one who had brought the gift had removed the signal.
He is not a gregarious animal the Boer.
Except for expeditions of murder or rapine, when expediency forces him to congregate, he prefers to wallow in his own sty.
He does not enjoy night-work, either.
The night to him is thronged with "spooks" and other nameless horrors which he does not care to face.
He can murder a Kaffir in the most atrocious fashion, and think nothing about it as long as the sun shines, but he dreads that Kaffir's "spook" after the sun sets.
Even the uncertain light of the moon doesn't seem to comfort him greatly.
He has no humour in its sprightly and harmless sense.
He can appreciate rough horse-play and clumsy practical jokes, particularly if there be a strong leaven of cruelty about them, and he is the joker.
As a nation, the Boers have not wit enough to be sarcastic, although they can be bitter enough at times, and harsh always.
But they are possessed, in its most childish, morbid, and undeveloped state, of imagination.
During the day they are hard-headed, callous-hearted, keen-eyed men, ever on the outlook to best their neighbours and grab what advantage they can.
Generations of previous warfare have made them quick and sure with their aim, perfect horsemen, and the finest skulkers in the world.
By day they are impervious and vulture-eyed, and, according to their own uncivilised mode of conducting warfare, dogged and resolute, if not brave.
We cannot call a man brave who slinks behind kopjes and circumvents his enemy only by treachery; yet, when driven into a hard corner, they will turn and fight with the viciousness of desperate rats.
But at night they are a most timorous and superstitious set of shrinkers.
Every strange sound makes their flesh creep and their hair bristle.
The kloofs, and veldt, and karri are packed with evil spirits, whose weird revels they no more dare disturb, than would a jackal a lion while he is feeding.
Their God is the Lord of vengeance, their religion a hotchpotch of rank superstition.
Our heroes did not fear greatly that the cell would be disturbed while they were out of it.
The prisoners were deputed to do the cleaning once a week, and Saturday was the day ordained for this duty.
On Sundays they were allowed to rest, as according to the Transvaal laws, no trekking, or work of any kind, was permitted on that day.
It was Thursday now, therefore they were almost positive that after they were driven out, the door would be locked until their return at sunset.
How wearily the hours dragged on during that day which they fondly trusted was to be their last in this slavery!
It was dry weather, fortunately being the middle of the winter season, as Nylstroom in the summer was one of the most malarial districts.
Yet the sun blazed fiercely down upon the exposed and shelterless place where they worked, and tried them all severely.
The mounted warders even became slothful with their whips as the morning advanced, and found smoking more to their minds than browbeating their charges.
Ned and his two chums toiled on even harder than they had ever done before.
They were thrilling with suppressed excitement, and felt glad of the work that made the hours pass.
They scarcely lifted their heads or rested until the call came for the midday meal.
Mealie-porridge for breakfast, dinner, and supper becomes monotonous; yet they were thankful enough even for this fare when it was served out to them.
A mad longing for beef had been on them for some days past.
The thought of it blended with their desire for liberty, so that they could think of little else.
"Oh for a grilled steak!"
groaned Clarence and Fred, as they bolted their unsavoury mixture.
"We'll have it, if all goes well, for breakfast," whispered Ned, to keep up their courage.
It was a lovely dream, and they hugged it, and kept their tongues moist all the afternoon with the sweet anticipation.
It was astonishing to watch their companions the Kaffirs during that day of suspense.
They wore their customary sullen and apathetic expressions, as if hope had no abiding-place in their bosoms.
Not even by so much as a flash in their lurid eyes could any one have guessed that they were thinking of liberty.
The only sign our heroes could note was their extra patience and endurance.
When the cowhide ripped across their bare shoulders, they did not even give a quiver.
It might have been a fly landing on the back of an elephant, for all they seemed to feel.
As afternoon drew on, Ned and his chums began to husband their strength.
They dug the pickaxe and spades more lightly into the baked clay, and played themselves at working as much as possible.
At last the sun dropped to the horizon, and they were driven back to the tronk.
As they approached, our heroes looked at the walls and building with keen speculation.
The front was the portion occupied by the warders.
A couple of men were supposed to watch the back from opposite corners, but, as Ned shrewdly surmised, they did not keep a very strict sentry, otherwise his friends could not have got over the wall as they had done the night before.
For the few moments that twilight remained in the cell, they examined the ground and gave their Kaffir friends directions.
The poor fellows listened attentively to their chosen leader, Cocoeni, and showed that they were ready.
Then darkness came, and they began without delay.
To prevent the sounds being heard, Ned and his chums began to sing; the others also made as much gabble as they could.
In the other cells, which were divided by the iron sheeting, they could hear the prisoners quite distinctly.
It was to prevent them hearing the pickaxe at work that they were making the row, but as for the Boers, they had no fear of them troubling to stop a wrangle or a ditty as long as it was not patriotic.
Ned took care of this by starting and keeping up a few of Sankey's hymns which he knew.
While they were singing they likewise prayed fervently for their deliverance.
Cocoeni took the pickaxe, as he was the strongest man there.
With a few deft strokes he had broken the hardened surface of the floor; then, while he dug, the others scooped the earth out of the hole with their hands.
He went down by the side of the wall until he had cleared the foundations; after this he began to tunnel.
It took them till long after midnight before they got to the outside of the wall; then they began to dig upwards.
They worked very carefully at this portion, and carried the debris into the cell by relays.
At last they had reached the surface, and as some of the earth fell in upon them, they were able to see the stars.
To their joy this side of the wall was buried in darkness, for the moon was on the other side.
Ned looked out carefully as soon as the passage was wide enough.
Halfway across the yard the shadow fell, leaving a patch of whiteness for some fifteen feet between that and the outer wall, which was about ten feet in height.
At each angle a sentry-box stood clearly revealed.
As far as Ned could see, they were unoccupied.
The sentinels had evidently left their post, and the passage was clear.
One by one they crept out, Cocoeni bringing the pickaxe with him.
As they stood by the wall, Cocoeni whispered softly to Ned--  "Wait, Baas.
I creep round and see if no one about."
He crept off without a sound, while they watched and listened.
In a moment more he was back.
"All safe that way, Baas.
Now for the other side."
They saw his dark figure glide along the whitewashed wall till he reached the end, then he disappeared round the corner.
He was longer gone this time, and when he returned, he was carrying a heavy load.
As he reached them, he laid his burden gently down and stretched himself up.
"One Boer done for, Baas.
Just caught him in time and brought him along," he whispered.
"You put on him clothes and take him gun, and it will be safe."
"Is he dead?"
asked Ned, horror-struck.
"Yes, Baas.
Me make no mistake with pickaxe.
Other fellow court him gal on the other side.
Quick put on him coat and hat, and go over to the box.
You see other fellow from there.
If he still wait, hold up hand."
Ned, repugnant as the task was, felt the wisdom of acting upon the suggestion of Cocoeni.
Swiftly he drew off the coat and hat from the dead Boer and put them on; then, bracing on his bandolier and revolver-belt, he took up the rifle and boldly crossed the line of light to the sentry-box.
There were no windows to this end of the building, while from where he stood he could see the front gate, outside of which stood the figure of a stout-built woman pressing against the rails, while inside was the other sentry, with his face to her and his back to his duty.
They were having their upsitting, or rather upstanding, in the moonlight, and seemingly totally oblivious to any one or anything else.
It was gruesome to think of that bleeding corpse within the shadow, and those ponderous lovers looking at each other with speechless and moonstruck admiration.
Ned shuddered to think of it, and now he was wearing the blood-soaked hat at the same time.
However, there was no time to moralise.
That Boer lover was likely to stand there until daybreak without budging, but some one else might come.
He put up his hand, and at the signal the seventeen figures left their shelter and glided across like spectres.
Ned could watch them and the pair at the gate.
He was also able to make out that ghastly figure which they had left behind.
Cocoeni bent his back and put his head against the wall, while one by one they clambered over him and dropped out of sight.
"Now, Baas, your turn," said the Kaffir, softly.
Ned laid down his rifle and walked over to Cocoeni.
"How are you going to get up?"
You go first, I come after."
In a moment Ned was on the wall.
"Come on, Cocoeni."
"Wait a bit, Baas."
Cocoeni ran over to the sentry-box and snatched up the rifle, then he returned.
"Catch, Baas, and get down other side.
I be with you presently."
Ned saw him run back a few yards and then take a flying leap.
Next instant the Kaffir was beside him on the ground, and they were free.
So far all had gone well.
Their danger now lay in the open country, which spread as clear under the moonlight as if it had been day.
As they got away from the tronk wall they could easily be seen and potted by any of the authorities who might be posted about.
However, this had to be risked, and the only course they could pursue at present was beside the main track.
They therefore set off as fast as they could run, keeping to the grass, and making for the kopjes, which were some distance away.
Ned had a notion that they would not have far to go before they met their friends, if their escape had not been already observed.
Cocoeni kept alongside of our heroes, and carried both the rifle and pickaxe, which he had taken a fancy for since the gory deed it had been the instrument of.
The rest scattered and kept on abreast over the valley.
They ran past a couple of small houses, rousing the dogs, who started a chorus of loud yelps, but without disturbing the inmates, apparently.
They were clear of the township now, and with the open country before them, yet by no means out of rifle-range, when a most unlucky accident happened.
Cocoeni, by some carelessness or want of knowledge, suddenly let off the loaded rifle with a bang loud enough to wake the dead.
Fortunately he had the rifle on his shoulder and pointing skyward, so that no one was hurt, but the effect meant disaster.
It would rouse every Boer who heard it, and raise the tronk-keepers.
"You have done it this time, Cocoeni!"
"Now it must be neck or nothing.
Forward, boys, with all the wind you can put on."
There was no time to look behind and see what result that shot had produced.
One and all spun over the ground like racers.
came the bullets after them.
The burghers had got out of their beds, and were driving away at them from the windows of the two houses.
One poor Kaffir flung up his hands and fell on his face.
The death of the sentry had already been avenged.
Up the hillside they rushed; they were amongst the stones now, therefore better able to dodge the bullets.
For one instant Ned glanced back, and what he saw quickened his paces.
From the tronk gates a body of horsemen were riding out, and spreading out upon the road.
"We're done for!"
"They'll be up to us in five minutes."
At this instant his ears caught a clattering of hoofs in front of him, and, looking forward, he saw half a dozen horsemen galloping along the road, with three empty saddled horses amongst them.
we are saved!"
he cried joyously.
"Not yet, my son; but jump up without delay, and we'll do our best," answered one of the riders, as they reined up beside the escaped prisoners.
you've got a tribe with you, I see," said the leader, as Ned and his chums sprang into the empty saddles.
"Yes; what about them?"
"They must run for it and take their chance; we have no more horses here."
"Never mind us, Baas.
We know where to hide.
You get along.
The Boers will follow you."
"Good-bye, brothers," shouted Ned.
"Good-bye, Baas!
I'll see you again by-and-by, never fear," cried Cocoeni in his full, deep tones.
Next instant the troop were riding at full speed, while the Kaffirs had disappeared as if the earth had swallowed them.
cried the leader, after they had ridden about a couple of miles at full speed.
The company at once pulled in their well-trained horses and stood stock-still.
They had quitted the track, and were now just behind the crest of a kopje, so that their pursuers could not be seen.
"There, lads, change your prison togs for these more befitting rigs-out, and eat some of that tucker while we settle off a few of these accursed Kruger whelps.
We have a ride before us which will beat Turpin's ride to York--for distance, at least--before we can next draw rein."
His men had dismounted while he was speaking to our heroes, and ran back to the kopje's crest.
They were now resting on their stomachs and taking aim at the approaching Boers.
As he spoke he pointed to a bundle which was fastened to each of their saddles.
"Get into these as fast as you can slip, and put inside you what you find in the centre of each swag.
We must be off again within the next five minutes."
Saying these words rapidly, he left them and the horses, and ran up to join his companions.
Our heroes were out of their saddles, and had the bundles unrolled before he had run half a dozen feet.
By the time he had taken his place on the kopje-top, they had got the riding pants and boots on, and were buttoning up.
In half a moment more they were bracing on their waist-belts and bandoliers, etc., ready for the journey.
Then they opened the saddle-bags and commenced devouring some biltong and biscuit, washing this down with modest sips of cold tea which they found in their water-bottles.
Their teeth were sharp and their appetites keen with long fasting, therefore they made the welcome viands disappear as rapidly as they had dressed.
Meantime those on the mound-top were busy.
The Boers had galloped up with somewhat rash confidence, thinking that they had unarmed men to cope with.
Those in hiding reserved their fire until the Boers were within a hundred yards.
Then they fired unanimously, and emptied six saddles.
There were only seven burghers left, and they drew rein in sudden consternation.
went the second volley, and only one warder was left upright.
Without waiting for his quietus, he wheeled about with the utmost promptitude, and raced back to the tronk as fast as his horse could carry him.
They let him go, satisfied with the slaughter they had committed, and, rising, they ran back to their horses and mounted in hot haste.
"It is saddle and spurs now, boys, until we get over the border.
This morning's work will raise the Transvaal.
No more was said, but at their utmost speed they set off, and dashed over the country as if doing a race.
Mile after mile they sped without slackening rein for an instant.
The moon went down by the west, and the stars grew dim.
When the day broke they were at least twenty miles from Nylstroom, and in the midst of a wild and lonely scrub.
They had reached a fording-place on one of the tributaries of the Limpopo river, and were approaching a native kraal.
Here they saw a crowd of natives, and with them four horsemen, with a number of spare horses.
"You see we have made preparations for you youngsters; at every twenty miles we have relays waiting right on to Palla station.
There we shall find a sufficient force to back us up if there is any fighting to be done."
The natives, who, although under Boer control, hated them furiously, had beer and roasted meat ready for the new-comers.
Galloping up, they flung themselves off their exhausted beasts and rapidly transferred their saddles and bridles to the fresh horses.
The fagged steeds were turned out to grass.
Five minutes only they stayed at this kraal, and while devouring their meat and drink standing, they told the men who had been waiting about their last encounter.
"We must get through before the news can spread, and avoid, if possible, any more encounters; so here goes to beat the record."
Together they all dashed on at the same speed as before.
That morning our heroes had their first glimpse of some of the wild game of Africa.
They saw in the distance a herd of quagga, and shortly afterwards sighted some giraffes fleeting away much more rapidly than they were doing.
It was a beautiful and varied country they were passing so rapidly through.
But they were too deeply engrossed in the effort to get out of it to pay much attention to what they might otherwise have noted.
In another couple of hours they were joined by a fresh company of four, and again mounted.
By midday they had dashed across the border-line, having covered over a hundred and thirty miles in less than nine hours.
It was the longest and fastest ride at one stretch which Ned and his chums had ever taken, and by this time they were almost bent double with fatigue.
But they were safe from Kruger and his myrmidons.
Clear out of the country, to which they vowed only to return with those who would terminate this vile oppression miscalled a republic.
It was their last stage.
A few more miles, and they would be at the Palla Road railway stations, where they could wait for the up-train to Bulawayo.
They slackened pace now that they were so near the end of their desperate race.
As they cantered along, they took out the remainder of their provender and emptied their water-bags; then, considerably refreshed, they began to converse.
There had been no leisure to see much of each other during this record ride.
Of the country our heroes could recall a flashing panorama of mountains, kopjes, and veldt.
They had passed through the half-cleared portions of dark kloof, where tall trees were shooting above dense undergrowth.
They had skirted mealie-fields and Kaffir kraals.
They had crossed half-dried streams, with tangles of reeds lining the banks.
They had startled quaggas, gnus, giraffes, and other tempting-looking game, and forced them to use their limbs over the wolds as the horses rushed along.
They had seen snakes spring aside from their horses' hoofs, and natives who cheered them on their course with friendly cries; all through that line the Kaffirs knew who they were, and why they were speeding so swiftly from the country of the Boers.
These natives, who waved their arms like signal-posts, were scouts who would have warned them had there been danger in front.
They had seen with instantaneous glances all that they wanted to see, and were fortunately saved from the sight of their deadly enemies.
But, until now, our heroes had hardly looked at the men who were risking their lives to help them over the border.
Now, however, that they were outside Kruger's jurisdiction, they ventured to examine their brave rescuers.
Twenty-six men, fully armed, rode beside them.
They were all tall and stalwart fellows, with the exception of the leader, who appeared short beside these six-footers.
They were also all bearded like middle-aged Boers, and costumed like burghers when on field-duty.
Dust-covered as they were, and swarthy with sunburn, it was difficult to gauge their years.
Judging from their faces and beards, they might have been any age from forty to fifty-five.
From their movements, however, and figures, they ought to have been much younger men.
"Well, boys," said the leader, "you have had a bad time of it lately; but I think your Transvaal troubles are about over--for the present, at least."
He had kindly brown eyes, and an open fearless look about him that greatly took with our heroes.
Also, in spite of his late exertions, he did not appear to be the least bit fatigued.
"Thanks to you, sir, and these gentlemen, we have achieved what would have been impossible otherwise," answered Ned.
"Yes; I own that Kruger's country is not easy to get out of, when the owners want to keep you.
One thing this ride has done, I fear--closed a good road in or out for any future trekker.
there will be a nice kick-up over this affair, and no mistake.
You'll have to make yourselves scarce for a while."
"But surely we are quite safe in Rhodesia?"
"Well, that remains to be seen.
Kruger will make a mountain out of this ant-hill.
Cables will be sent to the Home Government, demanding their prisoners to be arrested and returned to them, and large indemnities for the potted burghers."
"And what will the British Government do?"
"Sacrifice you, without a pause, to pacify the old man of Pretoria, and us also, if we can be traced."
"Then we have got you into a bad fix, I fear," said Ned, regretfully.
"Oh, don't concern yourselves about us; we are ready with our alibis," answered the leader, with a merry laugh.
"These gentlemen have been on the sick list in Bulawayo hospital for the past three weeks, while I have been looking after the health of my friend and chief, Cecil Rhodes."
"I say, Jim," said one of the others, "do you consider it safe for us to take the up train to Bulawayo?"
"Perfectly safe.
There will be a special waiting for us at Palla, and we will hang on till after sundown before we board her.
A wire up to headquarters will prepare them for our arrival, then you boys can sneak back to your nurses, while we make our way to Salisbury.
We shall have to disguise you for that journey, but my friends will be done with their beards by that time, so one of these each will do for you."
At last our heroes understood what had been puzzling them as peculiar about their rescuers.
They had disguised themselves for this expedition.
Who could the leader be, who was at that time supposed to be looking after the health of the great empire-maker?
They looked at him again more closely, and then light broke upon them.
Dr Jameson, of course!
The hero next to Rhodes most worth following and worshipping in Africa.
He saw from their expressions that they had recognised him.
"Yes, boys; I am Dr Jim.
But no one outside this company must know it.
Your friend Philip Martin wrote to me the fix you were in, so we thought we might as well have a little outing and help you away.
Now we must finish our task and make you disappear altogether from the ken of man.
That, however, we can discuss with our chief when we see him."
Words failed our heroes; they could only gaze at this dauntless paladin with speechless admiration.
After a time Clarence ventured to ask about his father.
"Oh, he is all right!
He was advised to clear out as soon as you were sentenced, as he could be of more use to you outside the Transvaal than in it.
He has sold his property and transferred his shares in the mine, and moved his banking account to Cape Town.
He is there also, and stands the expenses of this so far successful private raid.
By the way, he writes to tell us you wish to do a little exploring."
"Yes," replied Ned; "that was our intention when we left England, but I don't know how we can do it now."
"It will be the very best thing you can possibly do, while the hue-and-cry is out for you.
I think we shall be able to fix that for you at Salisbury.
Meantime, as we are within three miles from Palla station, and it will not be dark for a couple more hours yet, we had better take a stretch here and breathe our horses."
They dismounted, and while their horses were left to feed as best they could on the veldt, they flung themselves down to have a much-needed rest.
Pipes were filled and lighted, then most of them lay on their backs and smoked enjoyably while they looked at the deep blue space overhead.
No one spoke, they were too tired for that; possibly each one had plenty to think about as they lay there.
They had accomplished their purpose and wiped out a few of the general enemy.
They had also taken time by the forelock, and had not much fear of being stopped on the railway, no matter what telegraphic messages were sent on before them.
Kruger had his spies in Rhodesia as he had elsewhere, but these agents were known, and could be kept back by those who were working this affair.
Dr Jim had the most to think about, for after Bulawayo was reached he had a long distance to ride before he could drop his disguise and feel safe.
Our heroes also would run most risks.
But they had a fearless and keen-brained man to guide them and think for them; they felt they had not much to fear.
The sky was rapidly changing from deep orange to ruddy violet when Dr Jim roused himself, and said--  "I say, Lawson, you had better ride in advance, and get things ready for us.
We'll be after you in half an hour."
One of the Boer-like men rose lazily and walked over to his horse; then mounting, he cantered easily off into the dusk.
Half an hour later, the ebon sky was clustered with stars; then the company got up and resumed their journey.
When they reached Palla they found the station clear of all except the railway officials, and the engine ready for starting.
Their horses were put into a couple of boxes behind them.
Together they entered the comfortable saloon, where a good supper was waiting for them.
While they were enjoying this, the train was running along smoothly at about forty miles per hour, and all their troubles over for the present.
They made no stops, but glided on smoothly through the night.
When they woke the train was slackening speed, and the bright morning sun once more lit up the level veldt and glistened on the zinc roofs of Bulawayo.
They had arrived at the present termination of the Chartered Company's latest and most gigantic enterprise.
There was no chance of letters getting in before them, while as for telegraphic messages, it was too early yet for such to be delivered.
As they rolled into the station they saw no one about, except the station-master and one sleepy porter.
The town had not yet woken up, as they could see from the lack of wood smoke issuing from any of the chimneys.
Three of the men denuded themselves of their beards, which our heroes put on, transforming themselves into middle-aged men in a twinkling.
They left three young fellows, with their handkerchiefs wrapped round the lower portions of their faces, so that no one could recognise them.
These precautions were needful, even in loyal Bulawayo, for there were Boer agents here as well as elsewhere.
The horses were detrained, and led off by their owners to the stables of the Palace Hotel, where faithful grooms were waiting to receive them.
After delivering over their steeds, each man went by different directions back to the hospital.
As far as they were concerned the ruse had been entirely successful.
As for the special train, it took on a fresh supply of fuel and water, and dashed off down the line again.
When the townsmen of Bulawayo would get up and resume business for the day, there was no one to tell them that a special train had arrived and departed.
"So far, so good," said Dr Jim, as he sent off his wire to Salisbury.
"Now, boys, let us get on.
We shall find relays all the road up, and, although we need not make tracks quite so quickly, for the first fifty miles we mustn't let the grass grow under us."
They had filled their water-flasks, and laid in provisions while on the train, so that now they did not wait to look at this rising city.
They put spurs to their steeds and dashed away impetuously towards Gwalo.
At Imbembesi they had breakfast, having ridden through a lonely, undulating, and woody country.
The landlord of the small inn there was prepared for them, and did not keep them waiting.
After enjoying a good wash and substantial feed, they mounted fresh horses and went on at an easy gallop.
At Shangain they changed again, and kept on until Gwalo was reached.
Here they rested for a couple of hours, while the doctor received and answered some telegrams which were waiting.
"As I expected," he said.
"The hue and cry is out, but there is no one to stop us about these parts.
We must keep on all night, though, as time with me is everything."
As they rode out of Gwalo he said, "This is a most interesting locality from an antiquarian point of view: all round are ancient mine-workings.
Some day, when you can spare the time, you must come back and examine these remains of past races."
They changed horses twice during the night, resting and eating at each place, so that when morning dawned they had reached Fort Charter, two hundred and fifteen miles from Bulawayo, and had only sixty-five miles more to traverse.
At Fort Charter they had a bath, breakfast, and three hours' rest.
They rode easy for the rest of that day, and arrived at the Hamyani River Hotel about sundown.
They were only twelve miles now from their destination.
They were not at all fatigued, although they had been for thirty-six hours almost constantly on their saddles.
Their horses were also quite fresh.
Yet their leader, for reasons of his own, did not wish to reach Salisbury until after midnight.
They had, therefore, supper here, and afterwards lay down and had a few hours' sleep.
At half-past eleven they once more took the road, greatly the better for that short repose and brush-up afterwards.
Their ride had been absolutely without human incident for the past two days, except for those people at the hotels.
They had encountered neither horseman nor waggon.
At the inns their coming had been provided for, so that they escaped any outside curious eyes.
Dr Jim was in a most contented mood now that he had escaped observation.
It did not matter greatly after this if they chanced to pass or meet any one, since they were so near to the end.
He had rescued three young Englishmen from the remorseless clutches of his enemy, and punished some of that enemy's satellites.
"You are in great favour with the chief," he said.
"I don't know if he would have permitted me to leave his side at this time for any one else.
But when he heard your sentences he swore a mighty oath that you should not taste the cat, even if he had to go himself and pull you out."
"We also made a vow that we should not be flogged," said Ned, quietly.
"You are plucky young fellows, and have stood this journey gamely.
If you look after number one, and do your duty, there is a future before you.
Cecil Rhodes, once he takes a fancy, sticks to it through thick and thin."
"We shall try to deserve his good opinion, and yours also, doctor."
"Be true to your country, faithful to your friends, and never shirk your duty, and you are safe to keep the good opinions you have already gained.
Here we are at our destination."
As he spoke he turned into a gate that was held open by a young Kaffir boy, and walked his horse up an avenue of blue gums, that looked inky, with their pendulous leaves, in the light of the late moon.
The bush spiders were yet busy spinning their silky traps for the unwary, early morning fly, and the dew lay heavily upon those gleaming meshes.
They were entering by the back road to the spacious Salisbury abode of the ex-premier of South Africa.
On each side of them as they rode slowly along were the numerous outhouses and stables, all substantially built of limestone, and slated.
The gum trees, which had been planted within the past three years, were already thirty and forty feet in height, and gave out a pleasant aroma.
In front of them they could see a wide spreading building, surrounded by three tiers of verandahs, and terminated with picturesque pinnacles.
It was like a large hydropathic rather than a private residence.
A solemn stillness lay over this building, plunged as it was in darkness, and rising out of the shrubbery and fruit trees which had been planted and forced up regardless of expense.
Solemnly and darkly this combined mass of building and foliage, with the delicate filigree tracings of palm trees and other exotics, rose against the declining moon.
There was not a light to be seen in any of the windows.
But in a corner of the garden was a small single-storeyed building, like a summer-house, and here in the two windows facing them gleamed a ruddy glow of lamplight.
"The master is still up, Pete?"
observed Dr Jim, as they dismounted and gave their horses to the Kaffir boy.
"Yes, Baas.
He is waiting for you."
"Then, we must not keep him waiting.
Come, lads, and report yourselves."
He opened a little side gate, and strode through the shrubbery towards the lighted windows, with our heroes at his heels.
For the second time they were about to behold this colossus of Africa-- the man who never turned upon a friend, or took refuge behind an excuse; the man who considered his vast possessions as only trust-money for the good of his country; the most powerful and striking personality of the nineteenth century.
Our heroes did not tremble as they had done when entering the abode of the ignoble enemy at Pretoria.
There were no policemen here to guard this potent life.
He was hedged round by admiration and affection.
Nor had he any dread of the assassin's bullet, for he was a man absolutely fearless.
Yet they approached with timid expectation for all that.
Dr Jim tapped at the door, and a strong clear voice bade them enter.
Next moment they were inside a small room plainly furnished with a table, a few chairs, and a small camp bed.
They were in the favourite sanctum and bedroom of the modern Napoleon.
He had been busy writing before they came, for the table was littered with papers.
But at their entrance, he sprang up quickly, and, taking two strides, held out his shapely hand and clasped that of Dr Jim with a firm fervent grasp.
"Welcome back, old fellow, and you also, young gentlemen; let me congratulate you on your escape."
He pushed the spirit-decanter and a box of cigars over to Dr Jim, who helped himself.
Then he looked at our heroes with a genial smile.
"You have been already adding a line to our history, and making yourselves famous in Africa," he said.
"I have here my orders to look out for you, and hand you back to prison.
Ah, there is a fine to do over this affair.
Thirteen valuable burghers gone under, I believe."
"Twelve I am answerable for," answered Dr Jim, calmly.
"The thirteenth was killed by one of the Kaffirs who escaped with us," said Ned.
He had been wondering how they had got on, and now enquired if any of them had been captured.
Nor do I expect they will be.
I suppose you made arrangements about their safety, Jim?"
"Yes," replied the doctor.
"They will be passed on to their own people by the friendly Kaffirs, while if any care to come up here, the railway authorities have orders to forward them without delay."
Our heroes rejoiced to hear this news, for their Kaffir friends had lain heavy on their minds since they had parted from them.
"Then, by this time they are into British territory, for these fellows know their way about much better than either the Boers or we do.
We shall have them up here in a few days.
Now, I suppose, you are ready for your breakfast, and bed afterwards?"
Our heroes were ready for their beds at least, although they declined the offer of any more refreshments.
"Right you are."
Cecil Rhodes pressed an electric knob at his side, and in another moment the Kaffir boy Pete appeared.
"Show these young gentlemen to their bedrooms, Pete, and afterwards go to your own lair.
I shall not require you any more this morning."
He nodded to our heroes as he resumed his seat at the table.
"We shall have a chat after you have rested.
Don't hurry up before noon.
Breakfast will be sent up to your bedrooms.
Now, Jim, old fellow, you can do without sleep, I know, and there are three hours' hard work before us here to get over ere I can let you go."
Dr Jim drew a chair up to the table, and prepared to listen to instructions.
"I guess it is no sinecure that post of Dr Jim's," said Ned to his chums as they left the little house and walked after Pete towards the big one.
"When does your master sleep, Pete?"
"Never, I think," answered the boy.
"He is always working and wide awake.
When sun rises he will be off to the veldt for a long ride with Baas Jim, then all the day they will be working again.
Sometimes he lie down on that little bed for half an hour after lunch, or he have a nap in his chair after dinner, but that is all he takes of sleep."
When they got inside, the boy set on the electric light in the hall and staircase to show them up to their rooms.
There he left them, as they desired him, to manage for themselves.
Three nights before they had been slaves, with only a caked earth floor to lie upon.
They were now the occupants of a sumptuous bedroom each, with every comfort and appliance that unlimited wealth could procure.
Full of heartfelt gratitude, they knelt and poured out their thanks to the God who had protected them and liberated them from the house of bondage.
Neither did they forget to blend the names of those who had been the instruments in His hands of their deliverance.
Lastly, they prayed that He might watch over and guard the dark-skinned brothers who had escaped with them.
After this grateful offering they crept into the comfortable beds, and very soon forgot all the troubles of the past.
"Well, boys, at last we are having our desires and realising our wildest dreams."
Ned was the speaker, and Fred and Clarence the recipients of his sentiments.
Six weeks had gone by since the night they first slept at Salisbury, and now they were encamped in the heart of unknown Africa.
Cecil Rhodes, their benefactor, had taken up their idea of exploring, and as he never did things by half or in a dilatory fashion, he had fitted them with every requisite on a princely scale.
As it was dangerous, even with all his great influence, to keep them within the limits of civilisation, he packed them off promptly and secretly to the kraal of a native ally, and there they remained perdu until their carriers and luggage were sent to them.
They were young and lacking in experience, but, as Rhodes said, so was Joseph Thomson when he led his first expedition across Africa, and what the son of a Scottish borderman could accomplish, so ought these plucky and well-educated young Englishmen.
They had all the rudiments of science needful for their purpose, and experience would teach them the rest.
He therefore drew out a careful chart for them to follow, gave them full instructions how to treat with the natives, and, what was of most service, sent with them a full complement of tried native hunters, guides, interpreters, and carriers.
They had not a boy that was not faithful and trustworthy.
Each of them knew the man who had sent them, and could depend upon being well rewarded on their return.
Amongst their servants, to their great delight, were Cocoeni and six of their fellow-prisoners.
The rest had decided to return to their own people, but these, having nowhere else to go, volunteered gladly to join the expedition.
Cocoeni had some adventures to tell them of their perils by the way.
Fortunately, however, they had all got clear of the Transvaal without disaster.
Their outfit was thoroughly complete to the smallest detail.
A dozen of properly salted horses accompanied them, while they had eighty carriers to bear their luggage.
A good waterproof tent was amongst the items, with medicines, beads, and bales of showy cotton to pay their way along.
As for arms and ammunition, they had every weapon that was wanted for the largest game, as well as for smaller kinds.
They were also amply provided with the best and latest improvements in rifles and revolvers, and sufficient ammunition to last them for a couple of years.
Ned, of course, took the leadership, and his orders from headquarters were most liberal.
He was given a wide track of yet unexplored country to traverse, with full licence to use his own discretion.
"Keep a diary," said Rhodes.
"And jot down anything that interests you specially.
Watch carefully the lands you pass through, and their condition and possibilities, and make the best maps you can of rivers, mountains, and plains.
Above all, look carefully after your own health and that of your boys, and avoid as much as possible swampy and malarious ground."
For all the rest they were to do as they liked.
Hunt, enjoy themselves, make friends as much as possible with the chiefs, and avoid anything like aggression.
"Go, and stay away for at least six months, and when you return, bring a good report of yourselves.
And may the Lord watch over you."
These were the final words of their commander, who, with his lieutenant, Dr Jim, had come to see them make the start.
It gave them great confidence to have this great man as their friend and backer.
They knew that he had smoothed many difficulties out of their path, and also that he would not be idle in their behalf during their absence.
Kruger would not have it quite all his own way with Cecil Rhodes at their back.
What a difference had those six months of freedom and responsibility made upon them!
They were master men now in all respects excepting years.
With this large following to look after and provide for, what remained of their boyhood, which the prison had not shown, now had left them for ever.
Cecil Rhodes knew what he was about when he sent them off on their own account to face the dangers and trials of exploration.
"If they come back, as I firmly believe they will, we shall have three worthy successors to Selous.
These boys have brains and good pluck, and their prison experience will be all to their advantage.
I am pleased with them, and have every confidence in their fitness for the task."
So Cecil Rhodes said, as he waved his riding-whip to them for the last time, and returned to his own heavy and multifold duties.
Filled with fortitude and high hopes, our heroes departed, leading their company of followers into the tropical forest.
They were on the outlook for adventures, and from the first day they were not disappointed.
Every hour brought some fresh excitement, and opened new wonders to their eyes.
They were passing through a land perfectly crammed with animal-life, so that there was no fear of going supperless to sleep, so far at least.
Our heroes had been wonderfully particular in keeping their diaries for the first week or two.
A good deal oppressed with the importance of their mission, and fresh to the work of note-taking, they cudgelled their brains to find far-fetched and varied expressions, so as to give their efforts literary style.
Their models in style were those ponderous and laboured essays which generally find favour with dictation masters, where a word repeated is considered bad form.
The result was that their descriptions were of the grand, verbose, and vague order, rather than the terse and realistic.
Striving to produce effect and variety of language, they at times forgot the main object, which was to make themselves intelligible, and present the route vividly in few words.
Redundancy is the failing of juvenile literature.
Brevity the soul of experience as well as wit, and simplicity the gift only of poets and matured masters.
They went along, more often thinking of what they should write, than watching for material by the way.
They pulled out their pocket-books when any particularly erudite words or expressions occurred to them, and jotted these down with supreme satisfaction, to drag them in somehow in the day's log.
At nights, while sitting at their camp fires, they compared these high-falutin notes, and mutually congratulated each other over these jaw-crackers.
It was a sweet joy to read them over aloud, and roll them round their tongues.
They were most generous to each other in imparting their critical advice, and sharing their choice expressions, while, as they had all been educated in the same school, the three logs, rolled into one, was written down by Ned, and after great deliberation and corrections, was laid aside as the final copy.
This was composed and written, as they fondly imagined, for the printers.
They were mighty particular, therefore, over it, so that it would read smoothly and roundly, and when done, they compared it with other travellers' works that they had read, with happy conceit.
Herodotus and Mungo Parke, they admitted modestly, had done as well, perhaps.
Joseph Thomson also was pretty fair with his wise and moral reflections; but as for those other slovenly writers like Stanley, Selous, and such-like, they thought their amalgamated journal would keep them at a respectful distance.
This juvenile mutual admiration and camp log rolling was a great solace to them for the first week or so.
The journal interfered a good deal with sport and real business, of course.
Thinking of it made them miss many a fine chance and good shot, and several times ran them into real danger; but it consoled them all the same, while the novelty lasted, for those other unavoidable mischances.
Their carriers did not object, as it gave them many opportunities for resting, which they would not have had otherwise.
But Cocoeni and the hunters protested often and vehemently against this waste of time and opportunities.
The hunters, who had started full of faith in their young masters, lost a good deal of their enthusiasm and respect, and might have turned heel altogether in disgust, if Cocoeni had not flagged up their weakening interest.
Cocoeni was, however, their right-hand man and staunch supporter.
He was an enthusiast in deeds of daring and destruction, and equally ready to wash his spear in wild beast or hostile man.
If he grunted impatiently when he saw the note-book produced instead of the gun, he always did his best to excuse the weakness and explain the mistake away to his sable brethren.
this is nothing," he would say, when he saw the carefully tracked animal bound away unscathed, all on account of those note-books.
"Don't be afraid.
This is only the beginning.
By-and-by you will see our masters wake up and do great deeds.
By-and-by they will not write.
We have been together before, and I know them to be men."
A timely accident, for which Cocoeni was to blame, either with intent or through carelessness, terminated this fit of cocoethes scribendi for the rest of that expedition, at least, and woke them up to sterner duties.
Cocoeni, whom they trusted with their most valuable effects, was one day carrying the small valise which contained their entire stock of writing-material.
They were crossing a mountain torrent, which rushed tumultuously through a chasm and over a series of cataracts, when his foot slipped, and in an instant the precious packet was swept out of his grasp and whirled out of sight.
The caravan was instantly stopped and a wild search ordered, in which Cocoeni willingly took the lead.
all that was found of the contents of the valise were a couple of closely written sheets.
These Cocoeni brought back in a smudged and soapy condition after many hours' absence.
As for the broken valise and its pulpy contents, he said he had seen a greedy crocodile bolt these without compunction at one gulp, and straightway disappear into a dark pool as if he had taken enough.
Our heroes spent a doleful night, looking at their crammed note-books and those two hardly legible sheets of paper, all that remained of their painful and laboured efforts.
They had plenty of pencils, but not one blank scrap of paper to use them on.
The wail of Ramma rang in their hearts, and for a time they were disconsolate.
Then Ned plucked up his courage and cheered his chums.
"We'll just have to do a bit of memory practice after this, boys, and put down all we have seen when we get back to civilisation."
"Let us keep these two sheets carefully as a specimen of what we are capable of.
I fancy they will rather impress our great chief when he reads them."
Comforted with this reflection, they packed their note-books and the manuscript carefully inside their medicine-chest, and devoted their future days to adventures, and their evenings to criticism on the faulty writings of other travellers.
This cheered and elevated their minds greatly, until the time came when note-books and style were completely swallowed up by action as their valise had been by the saurian.
When Cecil Rhodes read those two rescued pages he laid back in his chair and wept.
When asked by Dr Jim the cause of his emotion, he replied that it was out of pity for that poor crocodile.
Even the most loathsome of reptiles deserved commiseration for such a dire fate.
We quote a few extracts from the precious manuscript which affected this most reticent of men so visibly.
A little will be sufficient to prove how thoroughly in earnest our heroes were.
"July 28.--The palaeolithic region over which we are passing possesses fertile streaks of fluviatile deposits that are most encouraging to future agriculturists.
This superincumbent alluvium is most effusive on the depressed basins or watersheds.
Here also the tsetse fly is indigenous and multitudinous.
Three of our horses have succumbed to the virulence of these pestiferous and dipterous insects.
"Memo.--The tsetse is similar in appearance and magnitude to the ordinary house epidemic.
"July 29.--After traversing for the past lunar month over more or less elevated plateaux, with intermissions of gorges and kloofs, we have commenced our descent into a deep depression, or valley.
Before us extends an umbrageous and interminable wilderness.
Precipitous cliffs bar our progress to the right and left, which have been gradually approaching each other until we are enclosed in a circumscribed upland chasm.
We must either retrace our steps or enter this lower level.
We have decided to proceed downwards.
Hitherto we have been on friendly terms with the inhabitants.
They have welcomed our presence and imparted to us all the information at their command.
They have also accepted our presents with the most affable liberality.
"The country over which we have passed has been generally adequately populated, with distinct communities and agglomerations of huts of considerable magnitude.
It is well watered by rivers and tributaries, and each village has its own fructiferous plantation, also fields of maize, manioc, and other granuliferous produce.
The Carnivora fissipedia is well represented in these upland regions, likewise the ungulated order.
We have encountered several lions and leopards, and demolished a pair of the first and one of the latter species."
[One of these first-named Carnivora fissipedia had nearly demolished Ned while he was making his notes for this elaborate extract, only that Cocoeni came to his rescue just in the nick of time.
Ned, however, did not think this narrow escape worth making a note about.
It was merely a personal item, he said, which could not possibly interest the great public that he was striving so hard and conscientiously to instruct.]
"We have been dining on buffalo-steak and elephant heart tonight, having bagged one of each species this afternoon in a reedy swamp through which we passed.
The pecora was a tough customer to deal with, as we failed to kill him at the first volley, but eventually he was subdued.
The tusks of the proboscidean weighed over a hundred pounds.
We have inhumed this ivory until our return.
Tomorrow we vertigate the forest."
Our heroes were encamped within the "umbrageous wilderness," as Ned had named it.
A howling wilderness they discovered it to be, where constant vigilance had to be exercised, and thinkers-out of verbose phrases had no place.
Each moment of the day and night they had to be on the qui vive, for it swarmed with hostile enemies, both human, inhuman, and climatical.
It was lovely in its tropic luxuriance and lushness.
They cut their path through a labyrinth of juicy greens and vegetable parasites which untravelled Europeans see only in the hothouses of their botanic gardens.
Great trunks festooned with tendrils rose and spread over their heads hundreds of feet.
They were able only at rare intervals to see the lower limbs, for all above was so interlaced and covered, that an everlasting twilight of green reigned even on the brightest day.
Sometimes a slender shaft of sunlight penetrated to the canopy over them and illumined a patch of leaves, making them gleam like old stained glass, but that was all they saw of the sun.
As for moon or stars, they were perpetually shut out from these secluded glens and avenues.
Round, as above them, the same mystical shadow prevailed.
They could see an intricacy of snaky rope work and leaves intermingling, the creepers crossing and recrossing in all directions as they drooped or sprung up from the dank undergrowth, or threw themselves from tree to tree in bewildering arches.
Through these tough tendrils they were forced to cut their path.
The compass was their only guide, and Ned carried it in his hand and kept his eyes upon it constantly while they were on the march.
Under their feet they squashed through oozy slime and rank vegetation, or tripped over spreading roots.
They skirted deadly looking pools, black, and suggestive of unknown horrors where the fluid was visible.
This was, they knew, only visible when it had been disturbed by the monsters who made it their noisome lair.
The other portions were covered with flowering reeds and treacherous emerald bright grasses.
There were paths intersecting this malarious dankness, some worn by human feet, others trampled by the ravenous beasts with which the forest teemed.
They passed well-made, fresh-cut, and straight paths at times, but they did not use these tempting ways, for they knew the traps which they led to, as well as they knew that murderous eyes were watching them from the closely woven thickets and impenetrable canopy that covered them.
They crossed streams where the clear water ran noisily over sandy shallows or flowed smoothly beneath waving leaves.
Sometimes the ground became elevated and rocky, then again it dipped into dark hollows that made them shudder at what lay below them.
At times they had to surmount precipices and listen to cataracts thundering down unknown depths.
At times they drew back with horror at the covered edges of inky chasms.
At night the blackness was palpable, except when it was rent up by the most vivid lightning-flashes and appalling thunder-peals.
Then they heard all round them the splitting of limbs and crashing of giant trees which had been struck, while the tornado shrieked high up and the rain poured down solidly.
The atmosphere was as airless, moist, and sultry as that within a Turkish bath.
Whether they walked or stood during the day they were always wet with perspiration and gasping for breath.
At night cold exhalations rose from the slimy soil and chilled them to the marrow.
It was the dry season, or none of them could have survived this march.
Yet it is never dry in those forests.
In the mornings the densest of fogs shrouded everything, and clung to them like a vast grey muffler.
This entered their lungs and nearly choked them with its thickness and heavy effluvia.
While it lay round nothing stirred.
Nature seemed dead, animal and insect life asleep; a weird and ominous hush brooded over the scene like the sombre stillness of a grave.
They were entombed and spell-bound with the universal and dim death-silence.
When this vapour dispersed, the labyrinth would suddenly start into life and swarm with motion and sounds.
Birds would shriek at the welcome light, baboons chatter and swing themselves aloft with merry and noisy antics; butterflies would flutter and gleam with gorgeous colours as they sported through the open spaces.
Swarms of fierce mosquitoes and other venomous insects buzzed and flew about, stinging viciously.
Ants dropped down their necks or rushed up their trousers in countless hordes and with maddening effect.
These tormentors never left them alone day or night.
Under the deadly bite of the tsetse fly their most seasoned horses fell one by one, and had to be left behind before they had gone very far.
This, however, did not discourage them, and when they came to the rock climbing they felt they were better without these poor beasts.
All night long the forest resounded with the roaring, trumpeting, and other strange cries of wild beasts, while round their fires they could see at times an outer circle of flaming phosphorescent eyes.
During the day they could see sometimes what they took to be a stout tendril or limb detach itself from the tree and glide noiselessly out of their path.
Sometimes also what they thought was a mud-covered log in their path would suddenly gape horribly at them, showing serrated rows of gleaming teeth inside the ugly long snout, while the seedy monster wallowed ponderously into the turbid bog.
These were only a few of the countless perils which beset them every foot of their leafy journey.
The reptile, animal, and insect world encompassed them with as deadly intent as the noxious vapours.
But what they had to look out for and dread more than these were the human savages who infested and disputed the upper branches with the man-like apes.
But our heroes were resolute, and held on undauntedly day after day.
They kept to one course with the dogged perseverance of Englishmen, and their followers followed after them with blind confidence.
The wild beasts and savages they scared with their gunpowder and bullets.
The malaria they fought with their medicine chest.
The insect pests they endured with philosophy.
They went along happy and fearlessly, for it was their nature to enjoy danger and exertion.
Their youth, buoyant spirits, and cheerful confidence not only supported them, but inspired their followers with the same fortitude, while their pure constitutions, unimpaired by any excess, rendered them almost invulnerable to the insidious grip of the fever.
In this their patrons had made no mistake.
Where older men would have succumbed they passed on unscathed.
"I tell you what, boys, I call this jolly fine experience, and I consider us lucky to have it," cried Ned one night, as he carefully took a bead at one of a pair of glowing green eyes which were shining out of the darkness.
He fired, and immediately a wild stampede took place from all sides with thunderous roarings, while a bulky body leapt into the firelight and rolled over, clawing the ground in its death-throes.
He had made no false aim this time, but had brought down a well-developed leopard.
"A pity we cannot take those skins with us.
The people outside won't believe in our stories when we have nothing to show on our return.
But we cannot cart any more luggage.
Never mind, we have something to boast about all the same, whether we are credited or not, when we get back."
"If we get back," murmured Clarence, gloomily.
Since his knock on the head by the Boers, Clarence had suffered now and again from depressed spirits.
The organ of hope must have been damaged somehow on that occasion.
At the present moment, however, he had a touch of malarial fever, which always makes one feel very morbid and despairing.
"Hallo, Clarence!"
"I see you require some more quinine.
Never mind, old fellow, we shall soon be out of this swamp; then you will be all right."
No one paid any attention to the dead leopard as yet.
They had grown used to incidents of this sort, therefore felt little excitement.
However, seeing that it was a magnificent specimen, and appeared jet black as it lay stretched out, Cocoeni rose and went over to skin it.
While he was so engaged, the others kept a close watch over him with their guns, ready to shoot any covetous molester.
As they watched the thickets round, they could see dark forms gliding about.
These were wolves and hyenas waiting to devour the carcase when Cocoeni was done with it.
From all sides resounded the howlings, sharp cries, and vibrating roarings of hungry animals on the prowl.
These never ceased all through the night.
Neither did the everlasting and varied croaking of the frogs, that kept up an increasing chorus, running up and down the scale of notes, from the deep bass of the bull to the reed-like treble of the tender froglet.
Through this orchestra sounded the irritating and brisk humming of the indefatigable mosquitoes.
As Ned remarked merrily, "No one could feel lonely while this concert went on."
They had no stint of fresh meat, for as they camped mostly where they found a running stream, the beasts generally had their choice of the menagerie as they came down to drink.
Sometimes they would pot a fine young elephant or a hippopotamus, while they could always rely upon some variety of the antelope family for their larder.
Each morning and night Ned served out regularly to each man two grains of quinine.
If any showed symptoms of fever, he repeated this mild dose every half-hour until they were better.
Clarence had been under this treatment for the past two days.
"How much longer do you think we shall be in this earthly paradise?"
asked Fred, as he brought his Metford up to his shoulder, and took a careful aim to the left of where Cocoeni was kneeling.
Ned waited until the bullet had sped on its deadly mission, then he answered--  "Not many days now, I reckon, Fred.
We have been gradually ascending for the last day and a half, as you may know from the more solid state of the soil under our feet.
That stream also, which has kept with us, shows that it comes from high lands by its speed.
I expect we shall have some climbing to do very soon; then we shall begin to see the sun and have a breath of clear air."
"Where are you going to, baas?"
asked Cocoeni, who had finished his skinning, and now returned to his place by the blazing fire.
He spread the hide on the ground, and flung himself upon it as he spoke.
"Straight ahead, wherever that may take us to," answered Ned.
"We will keep a bee-line as much as possible until we discover something worth reporting.
This course is out of the ordinary track, as any one can tell from the absence of humans; so that we are sure to find out something new."
"Plenty humans by-and-by, you bet, baas; more than you may care to meet."
"Still we shall go on, Cocoeni, as far as we can.
We shall be friendly with them, and spare them all we can; but if we have to fight, then we must do so."
"That all right, baas.
Go ahead, and we will follow, never fear."
Ned knew this without one of his men assuring him.
There wasn't one of them who would turn and leave him in the lurch.
They were all picked fighters as well as hunters, whose glory and occupation had been battle from their boyhood, while their pastime was the chase.
The oldest man amongst them was not yet twenty-eight, while the others ranged from eighteen upwards to that glorious period of manhood and strength.
They were also all tall fellows, belonging to the Matabele and Basuto races, who were absolutely fearless and disdainful of death in any aspect.
They were devoted friends of Rhodes, who had won their fealty by courage, and their devotion by kindness afterwards.
None would have turned back if they could, but now retreat was impossible, even if any would have entertained such a thought.
Each man carried his own share of the load.
In this duty our heroes also took their equal part, for these men were men-at-arms, not henchmen.
They had cleared an open space, and made a huge fire in the centre, round which all now lay, except those appointed to keep watch and attend to the fire.
High above, the smoke roared and filtered through the canopy of leafage.
For a dozen yards on either side the ruddy flames lit up the massy trunks, tendrils, and drooping leaves which hemmed them in, with the fringe of close undergrowth which gave solidity to the thickets.
They were camped near the bank of a torrent that rushed with impetuous force over rocks, foaming and swirling over and round these impediments, and covering the deep pools with curds and bubbles.
This was the most cheerful sound of the many that filled their ears, and it lulled them to sleep.
They had come upon it the day before, and as it was in their course, they had kept as close to it as they could.
By-and-by only the watchers were awake, among whom stood Fred, with his rifle ready for emergencies.
He, with Ned, had enjoyed perfect health since the start; only Clarence gave them any uneasiness.
He was lying now on three folds of skins stretched face upwards, with his mouth open, and very wan and sallow.
Fred occasionally looked at him with tender anxiety.
He also attended to giving him his medicine regularly.
Doubtless he would be all right when they got out of this fever-infested valley.
He was still able to keep up with them, although he had not carried anything for the past two days.
While Fred was looking at his sleeping friend and listening to the forest outcry, all at once he was startled by the most furious bellowing and hoarse shrieking, accompanied by the crashing and tearing of some huge body bursting through the thicket.
Instantly his rifle was at his shoulder, and the barrel pointed in the direction of the advancing turmoil.
Nor had he many seconds to wait before he saw a buffalo, with a leopard on his neck, rushing at full speed along the open avenue which they had made in coming straight towards their camp.
He fired instantly, as did also the other watchers, and before they could get in second shots, the infuriated beasts had thundered past them into the other side of the forest.
The buffalo had swerved aside at sight of the fire, and passed just within a couple of feet of where Cocoeni lay stretched on his new skin.
As the pair rushed past, Fred had a passing glimpse of the red blood glistening ruddily on the sides of the bull as it gushed out of his wounds.
Fred calmly reloaded and stood once more at attention, for this was but one of many such incidents which might be expected before the morning fog rose and enveloped them.
Towards morning Clarence broke out into a lavish perspiration during Ned's watch.
The moisture poured from him like rain for about half an hour, after which he sank into a more refreshing sleep.
Ned during this time kept him well rolled up in furs, after which he rubbed him dry and covered him lightly, giving him at the same time about a tablespoonful of brandy.
When he woke in the morning he was clear-skinned, hungry, and better.
After a hearty breakfast, they once more continued their journey.
They did not progress very fast, as they had to cut through the tangle, yet, to their joy, they found that they were ascending to loftier ground each step they took, also that the torrent kept beside them.
After about six hours of this steady upward marching, the undergrowth became thinner and the ground more solid.
At places they had to climb over moss-covered rocks, which jutted from the earth.
The tendrils, also, were not so thick, nor the tree-trunks so great in girth.
That night they pitched their camp at an elevation of over four hundred feet from where they had lain the night before.
The forest was still dense, but there were greater spaces between the trunks.
"We are approaching the open!"
cried Ned, exultantly.
"Tomorrow, perhaps, we may see the sun."
A herd of koodoo dashed past them up the hill, followed by a pair of large leopards, and in their rear a pack of spotted hyenas also coursed along.
They fired at random into the koodoo, and brought down four.
The second volley killed one of the leopards and wounded the other, who, however, made his escape, carrying with him one of the antelopes, while the evil-smelling jackals disappeared with savage yelps.
There was a succulent supper that night, which all devoured eagerly, as they were hungrier than they had been for some days past.
Next morning they rose all in a healthy and energetic condition.
The usual thick fog was absent, and the green looked lighter which spread around them.
All about them the winged insect and feathered world seemed more full of life and pleasure.
They were going up the sides of a decided hill now.
By-and-by it got so stiff that they were forced to drag themselves up by gripping the creepers that spread over and barred the way.
The torrent was now a series of cascades as it bounded from ledge to ledge a swirling mass of foam.
At times they lost sight of it altogether.
They were toiling over an upward spread of forest-clad terraces.
When they reached one ridge, they found several yards of gentle slope, or even level ground, with a jutting out of boulders to be surmounted after these spaces were crossed.
Still they were hemmed closely in with vegetation, and could only see a few feet ahead of them.
All at once they came to a kind of clearing, where the undergrowth was trampled down and the tendrils roughly broken asunder.
"Big man-monkey live about here," said Cocoeni, as he looked about him carefully.
In front of them were several gaping avenues amongst the undergrowth.
Ned decided on keeping to one that went in the direction his compass pointed to.
They went upwards now cautiously, making as little noise as they could.
There was no occasion to use their axes, as the baboon-path was wide enough for them to pass through in single file.
Cocoeni and two of the hunters went first, and some feet in advance of the others.
All were on the alert, with their guns ready and their hearts beating with suppressed excitement.
Not a word was spoken.
They even held their breaths as much as possible, and took care not to make any rustling with their feet.
This was new game to our heroes, and they were trembling with eagerness.
They crossed several of these open spaces as they scrambled up the heights.
Before entering these, Cocoeni scrutinised them cautiously and keenly, while those behind waited on the result.
Until he entered they stood still and mute as statues.
The only sound they could hear as they stood and listened was the loud-sounding and tumultuous rushing of the torrent.
This being close on their left, although hidden, seemed to deaden all other sounds.
At the fringe of the fifth opening Cocoeni suddenly drew back, and held up his hand as a signal for them to advance carefully.
One by one they crept up until they were able to see what he was looking at.
A strange, weird, yet singularly human-like and domestic picture met their gaze.
At the root of a huge tree squatted the most diabolic-looking mother-ape nursing her baby at her hairy breast.
She was a gigantic creature, with the most villainous-looking face that our heroes thought they had ever looked upon.
Yet there was an expression of grotesque tenderness and sentiment upon that dreadful visage as she looked down at her hideous youngster, that was half pathetic and half ludicrous.
One hairy arm was holding the young ape up, while the other paw was gently stroking its face as any human mother might have done when similarly occupied.
But if she was frightful to look at, her mate, who sat at her side and also watched his offspring with paternal complacency, was the most awful and devilish monster that the imagination could conjure up as a nightmare.
There was nothing ridiculous about him, but a combination of all that was revolting, bestial, and terrifying.
His flat forehead and pent brows; his dreadful jaws, which were slightly open in a senile kind of leer that exhibited his fangs; his shapeless, bulging paunch, short legs, deep chest, and long arms covered with dingy-looking hair,--he looked the embodiment of brutality, loathsome ugliness, and ferocious strength.
The first glance made them shiver with horror, the second filled them with the desire to kill this half-human, wholly fiend-like monstrosity.
The tree under which this awful group sat grew on the edge of a precipice, while in front of them the torrent could be seen and heard as it fell into the chasm, with a sound like thunder, from a lofty cliff.
With that thundering in their ears, and the vibration of the covered rocks under their feet, they did not fear being heard by the brutes in front of them, Cocoeni made a silent sign, and the hunters crept through the leafage to make a half-circle round the still unconscious family party.
While they were doing this, he drew back and whispered to Ned--  "Don't shoot till I give you the sign.
I know how to manage this fellow."
"All right.
Now for him."
Cocoeni stepped into the open, holding his gun ready, while our heroes followed him.
They knew that they must kill with the first shot or it would be all over with them.
Neither of the baboons had heard them, but they had got the scent of the other hunters, and looked up sniffing the air suspiciously.
In a moment the male baboon saw his foes, and scrambled upright, fixing his wicked and ferocious eyes upon them.
With a roar that eclipsed the thunder of the waterfall and echoed horribly in their ears, he opened his jaws, and grinned on them, showing all his teeth.
A tremor passed over them, and for a moment unnerved them--he was so horribly like an exaggerated Kruger as he stood there glaring at them.
He gallantly waddled in front of his wife and child, covering them with his ponderous body, while she sat still and waited.
This action on his part the young men could not but admire.
With another fierce roar he stopped, and beat upon his stomach with both hands until it sounded like a big drum.
He was getting ready for the fight, and bidding defiance to them.
Three more paces did he advance, then he once more stood still, and made the forest resound with his cries and drum-beating; then he threw his arms out, and crouched ready for the spring.
He was about two yards' distance from them by this time.
shouted Cocoeni.
Two rifles belched out at the same moment.
Ned and Fred had fired off, while Cocoeni and Clarence stood ready.
The monster flung up its arms and fell on his face without a moan.
He had been pierced through the heart and lungs.
The mother, when she saw what had befallen her mate, did not attempt to escape.
She looked at the prostrate body stupidly for a moment; then, as if suddenly realising the disaster, she placed her baby on the ground, and rose, as the male had done, to her feet with a barking roar.
Ned and Fred meanwhile had fallen back a pace, and put another cartridge into their weapons.
They were cool now that they had succeeded in their first shot.
She repeated the tactics of the male, only moved more actively, not giving them so much time to aim.
But their shots told all the same, even if she did not die so rapidly.
With a shriek she fell forward, after she was shot, on to the body of her mate, and there she lay moaning and gasping piteously.
Our heroes were transfixed with horror at this death-struggle.
It almost felt as if they had committed murder.
With her life-blood streaming out, the mother made a frantic endeavour to cover and protect her little one, who had run whimpering over to her.
She half turned, and got one hairy arm round it, hiding it on her bosom, all the while those human-like moans and gasps broke from her.
But the struggle was short.
Even while Ned was aiming to finish her off, Cocoeni gripped his arm.
"No use wasting bullets, baas.
She is dead."
Yes; the arm suddenly relaxed its maternal hold, while the moans and groaning ceased.
Only the baby remained.
Ned would fain have spared the little one, but the hunters were round it by this time, and it was fighting tooth and nail to resist them.
Before our heroes were able to reach it, one of the men had plunged his spear ruthlessly through its body, and pinned it to the ground.
With a series of shrill and plaintive cries, it writhed for a moment, then closed its little eyes, and was suddenly still.
"I don't care much for baboon-hunting," said Ned, with a shudder, as he turned away, feeling sickish.
"I hope we don't meet any more."
"If we had missed that fellow, you would have seen nothing more in this world," answered Cocoeni, deeply and sarcastically.
"Let us get on," commanded Ned, shortly.
Then, taking up their loads, they resumed their upward course.
It was some hours before they could feel comfortable in their minds after that battue--that is, our heroes.
The Kaffirs felt and showed no emotion whatever.
Our heroes, however, walked silently and thoughtfully through the greater portion of that day, and when they camped that night, their prayers somehow did not give them the usual satisfaction.
They felt as if they had assisted at a needless and cowardly massacre, and as if they merited punishment for committing an unworthy crime.
They would have liked to have asked forgiveness for this action.
Yet these were merely beasts who must have disputed their passage, soulless monstrosities, for whom it seemed ridiculous to feel pity.
The first and second they had killed in self-defence.
But the baby--ah, that was what lay so heavy on their consciences!
"I don't mind the old man one bit," murmured Ned, as he tossed about.
"He was too much like President Kruger for me to let him live, when I saw my chance to wipe him off.
He may have had some virtues--as Kruger may have.
They both appear to be fond of their own, and willing to fight for them; but that wretched pup--I wish I could forget it."
Events shortly banished this painful episode from the minds of these brave adventurers, and the jackals would soon remove the traces from the earth.
Like the leaves of the forest, the lives of men and animals are trifles of no more consideration than the shadow that crosses a sundial and marks the hour.
Ned sternly put his veto on any more monkey-hunting, big or small, as a cruel and useless expenditure of ammunition.
They were harmless if left alone, as they were not carnivorous, and totally unfitted for food, unless for starving men, which this party was not by any means.
Therefore, while passing through this baboon land, the company, after this one experience, avoided these open avenues as much as possible.
When, however, they were forced to use any of the paths, they made plenty of noise, which warned these creatures of their coming, and frightened them away.
It was small honour to the hunter, who possessed a sure eye, steady nerve, and a good rifle to destroy one of these missing links of man, who so bravely and foolishly stood still and made targets of themselves before they made the attack.
There were leopards and other beasts of prey to be encountered, whom to bring down caused no after reflections.
These were treacherous and murderous, and, as they lived by violence, so they deserved their doom.
On the next forenoon after this adventure, they emerged from the forest--at least, they reached an altitude where the trees were wider apart and not so densely interlaced.
Then they had glimpses of the blue sky and golden patches of sunlight across their path.
This, with the fresher air, braced them all up wonderfully.
They were still ascending, and were now fully four thousand feet above the sea, so that the tsetse flies were left behind them.
About midday they arrived at the base of some lofty cliffs, which reared above the tree-tops some fifty or sixty feet.
The torrent was still on their left, and had come to be looked upon as an old friend.
It flowed through a chasm or split in these cliffs, and fell into another abyss far below their feet.
They could see it dropping like a dark blue band between the branches, while their faces were bathed with the cool vapour which rose up from the pool into which it leapt.
A couple of rainbows arched this blue ribbon as the sun-rays glistened prismatically amongst the vapour.
These cliffs in front of them rose into the most fantastic shapes and pinnacles.
They were of all shapes and sizes, some exactly like ruins of castles, some like pyramids and obelisks.
To our heroes, as they looked up, they appeared like a range of deserted keeps and fortifications set there to guard the borders of a strange domain.
Trees jutted out of each crevice, while gigantic creepers swung like rope-ladders over the front of these strangely heaped-up boulders.
The long and twisted lines reached from the top to where they stood, some of them as thick as a man's thigh and others no thicker than a finger.
It was not at all difficult to climb the cliffs with those tough tendrils to hang on by, and our adventurers, without a pause, began the ascent.
At length they stood on the crest of one of these castle-like broken walls, and found that they were entirely the work of freakish nature.
They were rewarded, however, for their exertions by the magnificent prospect that spread all round them.
Under them they could see the forest which they had traversed, sloping downwards and reaching away until it became a blur of blue haze in the distance.
The fierce African sun was pouring down its rays and heat on this vast mass of vegetation, from which rose a film of unwholesome gas, that softened the tops of the trees until they seemed like a great ocean of blended tones.
A mighty silence seemed to brood over this vast sea of quivering colours--the pulsing silence of sleeping life.
Above them stretched that wide vault of atmosphere, the glad sight of which they had so long been denied.
One and all spread out their arms as if to embrace the welcome light and pure air.
Like the sun-worshippers, they experienced a kind of adoration for the glowing orb which was so softly sinking towards the west.
In front of them extended a flat prairie land dotted here and there with mounds and kopjes and devoid of trees, excepting near the banks of the stream, which they could trace as it flowed across the plateau from a far-distant range of mountains.
These mountains were so faintly outlined against the sky that they might almost be mistaken for a low-lying bank of clouds.
Only their peaks showed them to be land and not vapour.
Not a sign of human life could they perceive, either on the plain or on the banks of the river.
No kraals, no huts showed up even, although Ned looked most carefully through his field-glasses.
"Have we discovered a new tract of country, I wonder," he said, "as yet uninhabited?
I see not the slightest signs of cultivation, although it looks as good as Rhodesia or the Transvaal."
"It appears like it," answered Fred.
"Only I wish we had our horses."
"Yes, that would be fine, for this seems to be a happy hunting-ground.
Look yonder at the peaceful herds of giraffes and zebras.
I bet no white man has been here, this generation at least, with his gun," cried Clarence, who had now quite recovered his spirits.
The Kaffirs leaned on their weapons, and looked round them with glittering eyes.
Here, indeed, seemed a country worth trekking to.
"By George!
I do verily believe we are the first discoverers.
Let us christen it at once.
What shall it be?"
asked Ned, turning to his companions.
"Jameson Land, if anything," cried Fred.
"He risked his life to rescue us from prison.
He deserves this at least from us."
Welcome to Jameson Land, boys; and let yonder range of hills be called the Cecil Mountains and this stream the Rhodes River."
They pitched their camp where they were for the night, and soon afterwards were busy discussing tea, roasted antelopes, and fresh-made cake, which the Kaffirs baked from the flour they carried.
A young moon showed in the sky that night like a silver sickle, and the stars came out gloriously.
As our heroes lay and looked at these sparkling worlds, they thought they had never seen anything more beautiful than that overarching spangled vault of heaven.
God had been very good to them to guide them safely so far upon their way.
Not a man had been lost.
They were as they had started, all except the horses, which was, of course, a universal regret.
Yet they were grateful, and did not forget to express it before they went to sleep.
From the cries that resounded over the prairie as well as in the forest beneath them, all through the earlier portion of the night, they knew that there was plenty of sport before them.
During the night a most tremendous thunderstorm burst over their heads with a perfect tornado of wind.
Fortunately, they were protected from the full force by those granite cliffs that surrounded them like Titanic walls.
They had chosen for their camp a grassy mound, round which those strange-shaped rocks upreared.
The tempest came on, with hardly any warning, just after the young moon had set.
They could hear it sweeping over the forest before it reached up to them with a most terrific shrieking.
They had only time to drag their loads under the waterproof tent and secure that more firmly, when all the three elements--fire, wind, and rain--were upon them in full force.
What a spectacle this was to those who cared to look!
Our heroes crept to a split in the rocks, and looked out upon the fierce bombardment with feelings of awe and admiration.
Over the forest hung the electricity-charged cloud, like a great war-balloon that had been dropped from the bulging heavens.
From this ruddy and smoke-tinted mass issued a perpetual discharge of forked lightning.
These vivid streaks darted from all sides into that ocean of rank leafage.
It was a magnificent display of fireworks.
It needed but a moderate imagination to transform this driving cloud into a great demoniac air-vessel armed on all sides with Maxim and Gatling-like batteries of the deadly flame.
Without intermission the lurid flashes darted downwards and disappeared amongst the foliage, each shaft doubtless working havoc with those giant trunks.
From the point our heroes looked, however, they could only watch the forked streaks of brightness disappear amongst that yielding blackness.
High above the rolling clouds reflected this vivid discharge with a ghostly pallor, while the avalanche of driving rain in the distance seemed a swirling curtain of blue and silver gauze.
Loud and quick thunderclaps resounded, one peal after another, like the rolling of a hundred batteries of artillery.
For fully half an hour the flames and the loud rattle of thunder went on without a break.
They were above this aerial fire-ship, and could overlook its dark upper side from which no flashes came.
Over it spread a mighty shadow, moving as it sailed like a black opening in the sky.
It was driving rapidly towards them, and looked as if it soon must strike against the cliffs.
As yet no wind or rain had reached them; yet they could see the tempest coming, although there was perfect stillness around them.
They held on to the rocks, and watched the approach of this death-dealing cloud with fascinated eyes.
All at once it took an upward sweep, as if drawn suddenly from above.
As it did so, the firing seemed to slacken and become irregular.
Now it was passing over their heads and driving along with the speed of an express train.
At it flew by, it dropped a fire-ball into a large tree that grew a short distance from where they stood.
Like a reed, the gigantic trunk bent over the edge, and disappeared with a sound like a shuddering sob.
When the next flash came, they saw a great blank where the tree had stood, with a rift in the rocks as if a ton of dynamite had exploded there.
Now the rain and the wind were on them with terrific fury.
The thunder-cloud was miles away, pouring desultory and wanton shots on to the plateau, as it raced towards the far-off mountains.
In an instant of time they were drenched, while the tornado shrieked through the rock-rifts like a thousand vengeful furies.
The Kaffirs pitched themselves face downwards, and clutched to the jutting stones, for nothing mortal could have stood upright before that blast in its first force.
Our heroes crouched under the shelter of a buttress-like boulder and watched, still fascinated, that disappearing fire-cloud.
In a few minutes, from the little mound ran a hundred streams and tiny cascades into the hollows.
These speedily became like filled moats, which swelled upwards until the mound became an island.
Then the wind and the rain left them as suddenly as they had come.
The sky once more cleared and the stars burnt with increased lustre.
But their fire had been put out, and for that night, at least, could not be relighted.
Luckily, day was not far off, therefore they formed a square outside their packages, and stood at attention while they waited for the dawn.
Existence, for the next five days, was the most enjoyable that our heroes had ever experienced.
They were in a perfect hunter's paradise; in fact, so plentiful and varied were the specimens they saw, that the prairie appeared like a well-stocked preserve.
The game was so trusting and fearless also, that they had about as little trouble to bring it down as sportsmen at home have over pheasant-shooting.
It was glorious, but it seemed too good to last long.
When a man gets everything his own way for a time, he is apt to begin foreboding evil to come.
This is an instinct which is planted in man to warn him against improvidence.
Life is made up of changes, and neither success nor misfortune can last for ever.
Our heroes had been trusting entirely to chance so far.
What they killed they had partaken as much as they wanted for the day, leaving the remainder to be devoured by the beasts who came after them, and the morrow to provide for itself.
But now Ned began to think it wise to prepare a stock of food to carry with them, in case the present supply failed.
With this object in view, he made easy marches, and devoted a portion of each day to more deliberate hunting, turning into "biltong" what they did not at present require.
These were pleasant occupations to the whole company, and they went along with cheerful hearts.
As far as they had proceeded the land appeared to be ownerless, or in the undisputed possession of the grass-feeding and flesh-devouring fauna.
There were no pathways, no signs that any other human feet had ever trod over these plains prior to their own advent.
This was encouraging, but it also made them wonder.
To reach it they had come through a pestilential belt, which might have hitherto deterred humanity on that side.
But what prevented them from reaching it from other directions?
This made Ned and his companions thoughtful when they discussed and speculated upon the yet unknown problem.
Was it surrounded by impassable forests, or worse?
This they were resolved to discover, but the surmise of what might be made them take every necessary precaution, so as to be prepared for whatever chanced.
Meantime they revelled in the gifts which were within their reach.
They were possessed of everything that was needful to make adventurous men happy--excepting, perhaps, notepaper, and that luxury they had learnt by this time to get along very contentedly without.
The weather was simply perfect.
Hot sunshine during the day, with pretty nearly always a fair breeze.
Cool dry nights, when they could enjoy their camp-fires and their fur coverings.
They clung to the banks of the stream that still coursed along unfailingly.
It was of lesser volume now, however, as they had crossed several smaller tributaries that fed it, so that it was about half the width it had been in the forest.
But it was still of passable size and depth, considering they were in the midst of the dry season.
It flowed smoothly now, yet with considerable current, and with few windings.
At parts the banks widened out and became nearly level.
In these parts it lost its depth, and was a series of swampy and shallow marshes with a narrow winding brook in the centre.
These ponds, being thickly covered with rushes and jungle, were densely filled with feathered game: koorhaan, francolins, quail, and snipe, also flamingoes, storks, and ibis birds.
Once or twice they started some Koro bustards, and dined sumptuously on the delicate dainty.
They could always tell when they were approaching one of these marshy stretches from the dwindled state of the stream; however, after these were passed the beds became fuller again, as it was constantly being fed by tributaries, and appeared to be one of the principal watersheds.
Round the base of kopjes it wound, rippling clear and unceasingly over its rocky and clay beds; growing smaller as they advanced, yet with pools deep enough to furnish their daily bath, and fringed with brushwood enough to feed their fires.
Every hour they got within range of large herds of African game of some description or other.
Zebra, quagga, and giraffes crossed their path frequently; antelopes of every variety were met and shot constantly.
Droves of eland, koodoo, hartebeest, reed-buck, and other kinds, evidently throve here, in spite of their natural enemies, that were also plentiful.
They had several encounters with lions during the day, and never a night passed without their presence being announced by their loud roaring.
As the moon increased, they were able to see these majestic beasts prowling outside their camp, with their numerous hangers-on, the wolves, hyenas, and jackals, all helping to render night hideous.
Several times, also, they roused a cheetah, and seldom failed to bring the tiger of Africa to book when seen.
As yet, however, they had not met either buffaloes or elephants on this plain.
Ned kept strictly to his programme, and led his company straight across the plateau, only turning a little out of the straight course when stalking down some special prey.
He always returned, however, to his bee-line as soon as the sport was run to earth.
The distant mountains were his landmark.
Each day they were getting nearer and more sharply outlined against the limpid sky.
The stream trended directly towards them.
They had taken matters easy during these five days, seldom covering more than ten or twelve miles each day of straight travelling.
Some days they had not covered half that distance.
On Sundays they always rested; and as a Sunday had been spent on the plateau, they reckoned that they had put in about thirty-eight to forty miles since leaving the forest.
The mountains still lay, as nearly as they were able to calculate, about thirty miles away.
These had been rising gradually on their view, until now they loomed a considerable height over the horizon.
As far as our heroes could judge of the ranges, they appeared sterile, rocky, and uninviting; rugged in outline, with upstarting and fantastic peaks, that broke against the sky like great tors.
When the sun shone upon them, the adventurers could see patches of tawny light, with serrated edges and ragged shadows of violet.
There were also long zigzag lines of deeper purple, that looked like chasms and steep precipices.
Nothing like vegetation appeared to line those bleak and rugged ridges.
"If we are in the land of plenty now, yonder appears to be the land of desolation," observed Clarence.
"Yes; I fancy we shall see something different over there from what we have hitherto experienced," answered Ned, cheerfully.
"Fortunately, our friend `Rhodes River' still is with us."
"It is also growing, like the game, beautifully less as we advance," remarked Fred.
It was true.
The stream was only a rivulet now, hardly six feet wide, and not above the ankle in depth.
The game they were leaving behind, and a wave of hot wind seemed to spread from those rocky mountains.
They made longer marches now, covering on the first day twenty miles, and bringing up at sundown to where they could see the details of the mountains very distinctly.
During that day they had seen, in the extreme distance, a herd of quaggas bounding away to their rear, and later on had been able to bring down four white-tailed gnus.
These were enough for their supper, and they had plenty of dried meat.
They camped by the side of the brook, now less than a yard wide.
They had crossed no feeders for the past two days.
The soil round them was more stony and bare than it had been, yet close to the stream the banks were fertile.
Before them the ground spread like a desert.
The mountain range in front was forbidding in the extreme.
The nearer lap rose abruptly from the plain like a rocky coast.
Huge wall-like precipices, that looked impassable, except where great rents yawned darkly at places.
Ned examined these chasms long and silently.
The others looked at him expectantly.
"Well, Ned, old fellow, what do you think of those gateways?"
asked Clarence.
"Not much--except as gateways," answered Ned, quietly.
"Then you mean to go on?"
"I should like to see where they lead to--yes, we must see where they lead to," he added, in a more determined voice.
"It would never do to go back and say we were checked by a few rocks.
As long as the road lies open and our supplies last, I'll go on, if you will back me up."
"Right you are.
We won't leave you to go forward by yourself," replied both Fred and Clarence, while Cocoeni and the Kaffirs nodded grimly their willingness to go also wherever they were led.
For the first time since leaving Rhodesia the sense of his responsibility pressed heavily upon Ned.
As he lay that night and looked over towards the shadowy outlines of those barren rocks, he felt his resolution waver somewhat.
He had many lives under his charge, men who were prepared to follow him wherever he chose to go.
Where was he about to lead them now?
Death by thirst and want seemed to lurk within those desolate craigs, which revealed no speck of gnus upon their tawny and red breasts, and only the arid shelter of shadow within their stony flanks.
He curiously began to think what must have been the feelings of Moses when he looked at the naked peaks of Attika, after he had seen the pursuing hosts of Pharaoh overwhelmed.
These rocks in front of him could not be more inhospitable than were the red mountains of Attika.
Yet they had been the entrances to the promised land.
The rank forest had not appalled him as those stern, dry cliffs now did.
Yet the forest held as many dangers--indeed, it hid more varied forms of horrors than these chasms could: death in the shape of fever, and submerging in loathsome and treacherous morasses; from venomous snake-bites, and crocodiles, lions, tigers, and the poisoned arrows of lurking savages.
There was nearly every kind of peril to be encountered in the forest except one, and here it waited for them--at least, so it seemed to Ned and his companions--the peril of thirst, the most dreaded of dooms, next to fire, which humanity shrinks back from encountering.
Would he go on with those dauntless fellows, and dare that terrible risk, or turn back before it was too late?
The half-moon silvered the ground with cool lustre.
A little way off he saw several soft-footed, slouching forms prowling about, with swinging tails and luminous, emerald-green eyes, that betrayed them.
While he watched their restless motions, and the rolling heave of their lean hips, he became conscious of the musical ripple of that ever-flowing, if diminished, brooklet.
"It comes from those sterile mountains," he murmured.
"And while it still flows, we are in no danger of perishing from thirst."
Braced up with this comforting solace, his momentary timidity and irresolution passed away, and he felt once more cheerful.
Moses and Aaron had faith.
So had the other explorers, both in Africa and on the frightful waterless deserts of Australia, and many of these daring, purposeful heroes had endured all and returned to tell the tale.
With manly pride he crushed out all recollections of those who had never returned, and dwelt only on the lives of those who had come back.
"Nothing venture, nothing win.
If I bring down that nearest lion with the first shot, I'll take that as a sign that we will be successful."
The beast in question was squatting at that moment on its haunches, like a great dog, with its face full towards him, and its phosphorescent eyes shining like lamps.
It was less than thirty yards away, and seemed to be glaring full at him.
Doubtless it was waiting and hoping that the dreaded camp-fire would presently burn out, so that it might get one of those tempting figures which were stretched round it.
About a dozen of its companions were sitting or moving about, inspired by the same idea that now engrossed its leonine fancy.
It was a splendid target, for it sat as motionless as if it had been one of the boulders that were scattered round.
Ned smiled broadly as he brought his twelve-bore double Metford rifle to his shoulder, and took a careful aim at the dark space between those glowing lamps.
It seemed trying for a sign with a pretty certain conclusion.
Yet if he chanced to miss, then, indeed, he might well take this as a bad omen.
With a report that startled the sleepers, the rifle exploded, and made them all leap to their feet.
But before the sound came, Ned had the satisfaction of beholding the lion bound into the air and roll over on its side, with those green lamps extinguished for ever.
"What's up now, Ned?"
cried Clarence and Fred, rubbing their eyes.
"Only a bit of an experiment I was trying," answered Ned, laughing, as he watched the other prowlers scurrying off with their tails between their legs like frightened curs.
"That old fellow was sitting a little bit too near my rifle for his health."
"Was that your experiment?"
asked the boys, as they looked sulkily at the dead lion.
"You needn't have woke the whole camp for that easy practice."
"I wanted to see if I could possibly miss him, for I had made it the condition whether we should go on or turn back."
"As if any one could miss such a mark!
Your ordeal of signs is like what the testing of witches used to be--pretty safe to turn out as you wished it."
"I might have missed, you know; aiming in the moonlight has always some degree of uncertainty about it," said Ned, modestly.
"Some few of the reputed witches must also have escaped drowning, but precious few did so, I have read," answered Clarence, sarcastically.
"Then, I suppose, since you must have blown the brains out of that carcase, the sign is, `Go on and--risk it'?"
"Yes; that is the result," replied Ned.
"Go on and--succeed."
"That is the consummation devoutly to be wished.
Now, don't waste any more bullets on signs in the shape of lions--until our watch below is over, at any rate.
Be sure, Sir Oracle.
We are off again to the arms of Morpheus."
It was not by any means a dull camp since the diaries and note-books were destroyed.
Before this fatal accident matters had been slightly monotonous for Cocoeni and the other young sporting Basuto and Matabele braves.
Since that irreparable loss, however--to use Cocoeni's slangy English--"things were humming, instead of being humdrum."
They were merry boys, all of them, and could not have been more wisely assorted for such an uncertain enterprise.
Regardless of danger and privation, and well-nigh impervious to fatigue, they took their troubles laughing.
They made sport of their work, and, unless silence was necessary, turned their daily march into a Christy Minstrel serenade.
Repartee, song, and jest were the orders of the hours, and never had Ned seen a moody brow about him since Cocoeni brought the sorrowful tidings back from the rapids about the saurian and the valise.
Splendid-looking fellows the natives were, also; the flower and chivalry of their tribes.
Deep brown eyes that could melt with emotion, flash with courage, and sparkle with fun; lips full, and ever on the ripple with appreciation of a joke; teeth even and white as the purest ivory could be; limbs muscular, shapely, and supple, with epidermis smooth, sleek, and sheeny as satin.
Whether they were lying, standing, wrestling, or running, they were bronze models of grace and symmetry to draw the eye artistic upon them with admiration and delight.
Ned put them through their facings morning and evening for half an hour each time, before they commenced and after they had ended their day's march.
They took to this military exercise most congenially, and as they were quick to learn, very soon became splendidly drilled soldiers.
He and his chums had cause to be proud of these glorious young warriors, as with lightning speed they obeyed orders, forming squares, scattering out into skirmishing order, marching steady as Romans, and pitching themselves flat on the ground to the word of command.
With what they had learnt of British war tactics, added to their own native training, Ned had charge of as fine a body of men as captain or centurion could have desired.
Our heroes had not been so long from school to forget or forego the delights of outdoor games and athletic exercises, and these they taught their followers, much to their delight.
Cecil Rhodes, with that profound knowledge of men which has made him such a success, had not omitted cricket-bats, wickets, and balls, with the more necessary items of their equipment.
These furnished them with constant amusement at such times as they might otherwise have felt wearied when game was not in their vicinity.
Football was an unfailing source of amusement with these stalwart dusky athletes.
Ned was referee on these occasions, and Clarence and Fred the touch-judges.
Rugby was their favourite game, and as it was played on those level veldts, it was a pretty and exhilarating game.
Cricket also they enjoyed hugely.
They usually fixed Saturdays for their big matches, but some practised all the week.
Cocoeni became a crack bowler, and much of the evenings were spent in discussing the qualities of the different players.
They had also racing contests and jumping matches.
The steeplechases would have been eye-openers to some British experts, for these fellows could leap like kangaroos and run like racehorses.
They had wild tugs of war, and putting and throwing the weights; also wrestling, lifting, and club exercise.
In all these feats the Matabeles contested with the Basutos, yet never lost their temper once.
It was the general good temper and fine control displayed by those hardy young warriors, as well as their expertness, quickness, obedience, and strength, that made them such valuable allies.
Ned felt that his hundred and twenty-five trained heroes were equal to a thousand or more irresponsible savages, if they were forced to fight for their lives.
With these at his back, he was hardly afraid of any odds now that they knew and could depend upon each other.
Our heroes were well-trained and religious young men, and while paying such strict attention to their physical exercises, you may depend upon it, did not neglect their spiritual devotions.
On Sundays they conducted Church service twice regularly, each of them taking turns to deliver a discourse suitable to their audience and their own abilities.
They explained the Scripture as they read it, and did their best to demonstrate how good and beautiful, as well as knightly, were the qualities of mercy, purity, truth, and faith.
They showed their heroic and simple listeners that fearlessness, endurance, courage, and strength were only the common attributes shared alike by beast and man; that where the man proved his heroism and superiority over the beast was in his generosity and chivalry towards his weaker or viler enemy, and also in his humility, trust, and obedience to the higher and Divine laws of God.
When they told of that great and perfect Example and Sacrifice to humanity, those emotional Africans sobbed their sympathy for His sufferings for them.
He was the true and perfect Knight who faced and endured ignominy and death that they might live eternally.
They pointed out the living example of King Khama, who had proved that a Christian could also be a brave and great warrior.
They told about that other hero, Gordon of Khartoum, who did not lose his faith or courage even although so basely betrayed by those from whom he expected help.
The Matabeles and Basutos quickly comprehended and appreciated these specimens of fidelity and heroism.
They remembered, also, during the week what they had listened to on Sunday.
"You will be brave in the hour of danger, for that is your nature, I know," said Ned on one of these occasions.
"Be brave enough, also, to stay your hand in the hot moment of triumph, for that is the moment of greatest peril to the hero.
You can endure privations, I have seen; you must also learn to resist temptations.
The perfect warrior is temperate in all things, true to his brothers, and true also to his pledge even when given to a foe.
His shield is meant to protect his own body, and his body is given to him to aid and protect the weak, raise the fallen, comfort the afflicted, and keep it holy and clean."
These were boyish orations, but they went straight to the hearts of those child-like hearers.
The ideals were those of uncontaminated youth appealing to unsophisticated and malleable Nature.
Our heroes had no scoffers amongst their congregation, but only young men devoted to them, who were as easy to lead upwards or downwards as children.
Ned and his two chums led them upwards as far as they could; and made them to see how much better virtue was than vice, how much happier faith made one than did doubt.
Each had their departments to debate upon.
Ned showed the greatness of the Creator by botanical illustrations.
Fred brought in his chemistry, and filled them with wonder at the marvels he revealed.
Clarence explained the stars, and entertained them with the fairy-like tales of astronomy.
Thus their days and nights were fully occupied.
They began and ended each day with prayer.
As they walked along they felt that they were environed with unseen protection.
This inspired them constantly with renewed and lofty courage.
So long as man can rely on prayer, he need fear no enemy, for his buckler is impregnable.
On the next morning after Ned had killed the lion, they started at daybreak towards the mountain.
They had not gone half the distance, however, when the sun, which had risen brightly, suddenly became overcast with what appeared to be a dense, dark cloud, which completely blotted out the light, and threw a dismal shadow over the landscape.
Our heroes looked at the dark cloud which was so swiftly rising out of the east and overspreading the blue sky.
It was like nothing they had ever seen before, of a violet blackness, with copper-coloured upper edges that glistened metallically.
A strange rustling sound came from it, growing louder as it advanced.
Myriads of birds circled above this cloud, diving in and darting out from it perpetually.
As it came on with incredible rapidity, they could see it trailing along and covering the ground like a black pall.
The Kaffirs flung down their loads, and stood watching it with glittering eyes, while Cocoeni stretched out his arm and explained the startling phenomenon with one word, "Locusts!"
One of the plagues of Moses was coming.
Even while Cocoeni still pointed, the swarming insects with their violet wings were upon them in countless hosts.
They filled miles of space with such a palpable mass that only a dim twilight prevailed.
They covered the earth like a fall of snow six inches deep with no intervening space.
All the air was reverberating with their loud chirping, the rustling of their crisp wings, and the shrieking cries of the birds who devoured them wholesale, yet without apparently diminishing their bulk.
Our heroes were appalled at this numberless host, and dazed with the darkness and noise.
They staggered about trying vainly to shake the pests off, that dropped so thickly and incessantly upon them.
They slid and squashed thousands under their feet; while they felt sick as they watched their followers greedily imitating the ravenous birds, and devouring handfuls of them, as fast as they could chew and swallow.
For an hour this went on, as the rustling, whistling, shrieking, and living cloud of darkness swept over them.
Then gradually the air cleared, and the fierce sun poured down upon that glistening and writhing plain.
Not a blade of grass or leaf of herbage was left.
Around them spread a barren desert; even the river-bed was choked up with a moving compact mass of blackness.
They resumed their march, watching the cloud as it swept westward, and slipping about as if treading amongst slushy ice, over the ankles.
It was horrible.
It was sickeningly disgusting.
The Kaffirs, however, showed no disgust.
After gorging themselves, they filled their bags with these insects, and trudged along singing merrily.
"Are they good to eat, Cocoeni?"
"You bet they are, baas, bully fine.
You eat one, and then you will find out."
"No, thanks; I'll take your word for it, old man.
They ought to be good for something, since they have used up the country."
"Oh, next rains will make that all right."
"Meantime, I suppose there will be starvation amongst the game?"
"No; they will eat these as we do; after that they will move off to other parts."
In another couple of hours the company arrived at the cliffs.
The ground was still covered with locusts, which had been unable to rise, and the stream-bed was completely filled, so that no water could be seen.
In front of them yawned a chasm of about a hundred yards wide.
Wall-like precipices rose on either side and stretched upward for five thousand feet with hardly a break.
A few fissures and cracks were discernible here and there, but no ledge which could afford a foot or handgrip for even the most expert climber.
The ground was hard and stony, yet even here, as far as they could look into the cavity, it was overspread with locusts.
The stream penetrated this barren gully, and also continued as far as they could see.
Eastward and west these same smooth precipices extended, like a coastline until merged in distance.
Serrated on the ridges, at long intervals they presented similar openings to the one they now stood before.
Possibly these were water-sheds in the rainy seasons, but at present there were no signs of streams flowing.
After a careful survey east and westward, Ned decided that the Rhodes river opening was the most promising route to follow.
Without any more hesitation, he strode into the shadow of the cliffs and out of the sun glare, crushing his hundreds of locusts each step he took.
The rest followed him obediently, still singing as they went along.
A crowd of aasvogels had come down from their lofty watching-posts, and were busy glutting themselves with the locusts.
These vultures merely lifted their ugly bald heads and bare necks and looked at the invaders as they passed, and then continued their feasting, hardly budging out of the way.
After penetrating for about a mile of this shadow-land they crossed the belt of locusts, and found that the ground was ascending.
It was paved with water-worn smooth rocks between patches of yellow sand, and rose in a series of steppes.
In the centre of this channel, the brook still ran purling and clear over its stony bed, with here and there small fringes of vegetation at its edges.
All else, however, round and above them was sterile in the extreme.
A deep silence brooded over this rocky valley, which, although at present in shadow, was intensely hot and airless.
The sun glared on the upper half of one side, but the rocks in the bed still retained the heat where it had lately shone.
As they walked, our heroes felt as if enclosed in a bakehouse.
They were winding round a corner, when suddenly Cocoeni and the other Kaffirs uttered cries of affright and rushed into the middle of the running stream, where they stood in a line, trembling.
Ned and his chums at once promptly followed their example; then they asked--  "What is it, Cocoeni, that frightens you?"
"Look, baas, the bashikonay is coming!"
"The bashikonay?"
echoed Ned in astonishment.
"What in the name of this wonderful country is that?"
"Ants," replied Cocoeni, hoarsely, while he shivered with unmistakable fear.
"The bashikonay ants eat up every living thing in their way, and yonder they come in force; they have smelt out the locusts."
Our heroes looked when Cocoeni pointed with his trembling finger, and saw marching down the valley a vast army of ants, each insect about half an inch long.
They were in close order, and had divided themselves into two lines, one on each side of the stream.
So dense were they that they completely filled the valley, until no ground could be seen under them.
They also extended in a solid phalanx until the winding hid their tail.
They were coming along in perfect soldier-like order, and running rapidly, with their officers and scouts directing their movements.
"Are they so very vicious, then?"
asked Ned, as he watched their fine uniform motions with admiration.
"I tell you what, baas, if they see us they will eat us up in no time, and leave our bones clean picked.
No man nor beast can meet them and live.
They are terrible, and cannot be fought with."
"Then are we quite safe here?"
"I think so--I hope so.
They do not like to cross water; besides, the locusts are what they are after now, therefore, so that we don't stand in their path, they may pass on.
If the front rank passes on, the rest will follow."
It was an anxious moment, for our heroes had no desire to test the eating qualities of those small monsters.
It is not nice to think of being reduced to a skeleton so rapidly; besides, the agony of those myriad nippers at work in and outside every organ, disintegrating humanity, was frightful to contemplate.
Ned thought about the tortures of the iron boot with the boiling oil poured in, the rack, and red-hot pincers, etc.
; but even the imagination of these failed to come up to the vague horror of being demolished in this infinitesimal fashion.
Ages seemed to drag by before the front ranks were on a line with where he stood.
He watched the ruthless little monsters of fate, fascinated, and thought with horror on the myriads of ogreish, sharp eyes that might be watching these helpless victims in the tiny stream.
Onwards, however, they rushed past the human food, without turning to the right or left; down they wound their course towards the open plain.
For three and a half hours they filed along, until the sun had almost set.
Our heroes and their followers stood meanwhile with their feet in the water, and their eyes fixed anxiously on that moving mass that had hitherto left them alone.
Ned saw a large black snake drop from a crevice in the rock amongst them.
They at once closed upon it, and passed over it.
A ripple-like movement took place amongst the compact multitude where the snake had dropped.
This motion only lasted for a few seconds, then it ceased, and the army scurried on with methodical and ruthless order.
At last they saw the end of this frightful army.
Ned had attempted a futile joke about the Jubilee Procession, but no one had laughed.
These little beasts were not suitable subjects to jest about--at least, not while they were on the war-path.
They had come in one straight valley-filling line in the van, and they terminated at the rear in the same rigid form, with no stragglers dragging up behind.
As the last rank filed slowly past, all uttered a glad cry of relief.
Cocoeni pointed silently to the trail which this army had left, and our heroes no longer dared to doubt his assertion.
Where the black snake had been was a gleaming necklace of white vertebrae, and a flat grinning skull, and shining fangs.
Scattered over the ground were specks of varied sizes and shades.
These were the excavated and polished shells of insects and reptiles that had not been so prudent and lucky as were Ned and his followers.
The devastating bashikonay had passed along that way, and, like the Grand Army of France, had cleaned out thoroughly their line of march.
It was some time after the last of these resistless conquerors had disappeared before any of Ned's band dared to venture out of their sanctuary.
These might only be the advance guard; the main body might be coming on behind.
Therefore, uncomfortable as it was to have to stand passive for hours in the centre of a stream of running water, this was infinitely to be preferred to being caught between two such formidable hosts.
At length, even Cocoeni appeared satisfied that there were no more of the bashikonay hosts coming down this particular glen on that occasion.
He therefore suggested that they might once more venture on terra firma, and place some decent space between themselves and the common enemy.
This prudent advice they hastily acted upon.
Each man grasped his load firmly, and set off as fast as he could travel up the gorge, without standing upon the order of his going.
Traces of these awful ants were seen at every turn of the way.
Beautifully polished and bran-new skeletons, large and small, were scattered about in every contorted attitude of the most excruciating agony.
Serpents with the tail-ends of their vertebrae in their jaws firmly clenched; centipedes, scorpions, and other creeping and venomous things exquisitely manipulated and polished of every fragment of corruptible matter lay about, perfectly cleaned, yet undisturbed, and not a joint out of place.
Splendid museum specimens these were, going to waste.
Ned, even in his haste, could not help stooping and picking up a few of these as he ran along.
He was astonished at the deadly dexterity and skill of those voracious workers.
Not the most minute fragment of flesh, marrow, or sinew remained on any of those highly burnished bones.
It was amazing and blood curdling.
They had done all this without disturbing the order of their march.
Each insect had snatched his bit in the passing, masticating it as he rushed onwards, while those following after had finished the gruesome task.
It was numbers, with a fixed unity of purpose, which made the work compatible with speed.
This was, as Ned said, the biggest co-operative concern that he had ever seen or read about.
"I hope these insect fiends are cannibalistic also in their habits, and that the whole tribe have gone on this locust expedition.
It is something decidedly unpleasant to think that we may have to encounter them on our return."
Nothing that they had experienced in the forest had been at all equal to the horror of those half-inch adversaries.
As they passed those numerous and ghastly tokens of this most terrible foe, Ned and his chums mentally vowed that it would be better to push ahead, rather than retreat down that way too quickly again.
No animal that lived seemed too formidable to be able to resist them.
Before night came upon them and forced them to stop, they passed a group of skeletons terribly suggestive.
They were those of a lion, a lioness, and two cubs.
They had evidently been overtaken while sleeping in a little cavity, and devoured before they could move far away from each other.
They lay in a circle, with the gravel torn up round them, in their impotent and maddening agony.
The skeleton of the lion was on his back, completely curled up, with his thigh bone in his mouth.
The lioness was sprawling with legs far apart, and the cubs in different positions, each indicative of torture.
That night they had to do without any fire, as there was no fuel to be found.
Scarcely one of them slept, so unnerved had these sights made them.
However, the darkness passed without any disturbance.
Indeed, the silence of that long night was weird, for it seemed the silence of a universal death.
Nothing broke it.
No sigh of wind, no chirp of insect, not even the rustle of a night adder--only a deep and awful stillness that kept them awake with horrified expectancy.
Morning at last arrived, and they went on following the stream and the whitened trail of those demon ants.
The gorge was gradually becoming narrower, yet without any diminishing of those stupendous sides.
It was not more than half the width it had been, and as they looked up, the sky appeared like a ribbon of blue very far above their heads.
They were closed in now with rocks on all sides, as the chasm was getting more abrupt in its windings.
All at once they came to the head of the stream, while beyond them appeared only a dry and stony bed.
At this sight the hearts of all sank and felt like lumps of lead.
The stream rose and bubbled out of a little fountain, while round it spread a patch of bright green grass.
It was a delicious little patch of moisture and verdure in the midst of this surrounding vastness of shadow and sterility.
As they flung down their burdens and rested beside them, they felt as if bidding farewell to their only friend.
It had been a good and trusty friend to them for many days, becoming more dearly prized the frailer it grew.
It had saved their lives even at its last stretch, and now it was all they had to depend upon in the most uncertain future.
Some brushwood was found on the banks, and with this they made a fire and cooked breakfast.
Then they sat down to consider matters.
After a long silence, Ned spoke.
"Boys, we must see the top of this defile, and carry what water we require with us for the rest of the way.
I reckon that we are more than halfway through it, and we have water-bags enough to last us a fortnight with care, and provisions for double that time."
"Yes," answered Fred and Clarence, steadily.
"I don't savy going back yet, with those precious bashikonay behind us," added Fred.
"Then let us unpack our waterproof bags and fill them here.
We can keep on for a few days, and if nothing promising turns up, we can easily come back."
No one having any objection to offer, this order was obeyed.
The water-bags were unpacked, filled, and the stoppers firmly screwed down.
Then, after a refreshing wash and a big drink, they said good-bye to the crystal fount, and began their arid journey.
As the pass became narrower, it also became more steep and winding.
Sometimes the cliffs overhung so much that they lost sight altogether of the sky, and seemed to be walking through a vast fiery tunnel.
It was hot and thirst-producing--this climbing over those parched rocks.
The light never left them altogether by day, even within those closed-in portions.
Sometimes they almost wished it had, to shut from their unwilling eyes some shuddering sights they at times beheld.
They disturbed ugly-looking and venomous snakes, scorpions, and yellow-spotted great spiders, with other strange specimens of the reptile and insect world.
It was, as Ned had remarked, a wonderful land, this Africa, with its strange curiosities of animal and insect life.
They had seen already much more than they had anticipated seeing, in the forest and on the veldt.
Yet this long and weary passage through the mountains seemed to give them every hour some new experience of the weird and horrible.
As they struggled on, their hearts beat with expectancy of what was next to be revealed.
The gorge was longer than they had expected; three days and nights had dragged along since they left the spring, and still they did not seem nearly at a termination.
They were going in an undulating, yet on the whole pretty straight, course north-east, and they were ascending gradually.
Already they had risen to an altitude of over six thousand feet above the plain, yet the cliffs, instead of diminishing in height, seemed to tower more loftily above their heads.
It was an arduous climb, and felt prison-like and spirit-crushing in its narrow limits, yet, since it led them so straight, they could not but think it must soon end.
They reckoned that these most lofty cliffs must be the centre peaks of the high inner mountains which they had seen from the distance.
When the sun was above their heads at noon for a short time, it poured its rays down pitilessly upon them, and heated the chasm almost to suffocation point.
Then loathsome insects and reptiles crept from the crevices and frolicked in the furnace-like glow.
But at night, when the dew fell, it was piercingly cold and damp, even under their skin wraps and tent.
Only once had they been able to find wood enough to raise a fire since leaving the fountain.
Then the effect on the bulging and smooth cliffs had been like some of the Inferno conceptions of Gustave Dore.
"Two more days, lads," said Ned to his dutiful and unquestioning followers.
"If we see no way out of this lane by that time, I shall turn back."
They were, however, lured on by the windings and the perceptible drawing-in of the gorge.
At the rate it was narrowing it must terminate either in a cul-de-sac or an opening soon.
At last their hopes were realised, and they had palpable evidence that they must have reached the other slope of the range.
The ridges were getting lower, or rather they were rising to their level.
Daylight became stronger, while the chasm became once more a valley, and fresher air poured in upon them.
About midday they were hemmed in by only about fifty feet high of walls that dipped until they became level with the ground.
In front of them spread an almost flat ledge, and on it what looked to be the ruins of a citadel.
The crumbling walls and earthquake-rent towers which stood between them and the deeply blue sky attracted all eyes upwards.
Then an exclamation from Clarence, who had stumbled over something and fallen on his face, drew their looks once more down to the ground, and all stood still for some moments, transfixed with consternation.
Between them and the buildings lay heaped a perfect Golgotha of human bones.
It was like the valley in the vision of Ezekiel.
The ground took a slight dip at this juncture, then rose abruptly up for about seventy or eighty feet like an acutely slanting roof.
Upon the crest of this slope were built the outer walls and watch-towers of these ancient ruins.
In this moat, or depression, were heaped and scattered mounds of grinning skulls, gaping ribs, detached arm and leg bones, shoulder-blades, and the smaller phalanges, which proved at the first glance that these dry frames were human remains.
They were lying singly at places, in other parts heaped confusedly together in piles, just as they must have fallen.
From the space they occupied there must have been thousands left here to rot, or to be devoured by birds, beasts, and insects.
It was an ominous and an awful sight, which might well have made the bravest shrink back from those grim and crumbling walls.
A large and solitary vulture sat on one of the upper keeps, and seemed to be the only watcher left in this deserted fort.
He perched motionless and sharply silhouetted against the rarefied space, like an embodiment of spent disaster.
Ned was the first to recover his presence of mind.
Stooping down, he picked up a skull and looked at it critically.
It was dry and powdery, with the combined effects of sun-bleaching and time.
Holding it up in his hands, he said--  "The fellow who owned this, once upon a time, has forgotten his pains and troubles for many years--perhaps centuries.
He must have been a big fellow when he carried it, with a solid brain-pan, although it has now grown thin and brittle as the finest porcelain."
"A big fight has taken place here," remarked Cocoeni, holding out the rusty head of a broken spear which he had picked up, and looking at its shape curiously.
The splintered shaft was like tinder, and crumbled between his finger and thumb like powder; the design of the iron was ancient and strange.
"That vulture appears to be the only resident at present inside the fort," said Fred.
"Suppose we have a shot at him, and try the effect, eh?"
"No," replied Ned.
"Keep your ammunition for worthier foes; we may need all our cartridges by-and-by.
Meantime let us try to achieve what these fellows have evidently failed to do--get over the walls as quietly as possible, and discover what is behind.
Keep your weapons ready for instant use, and your eyes and ears open, boys.
Now, forward, in your best scaling order."
They ran swiftly through the crunching bones, and up the steep sides of the cliffs.
A rugged kind of hewn stairway led them up to a massive square-shaped portal, which was gateless and more than half demolished.
The huge stones of the posts were bulging out, and the top bending over.
As they dashed inside, the vulture rose with a hoarse scream and sailed lazily away.
Inside they discovered a large courtyard, heaped with fallen masonry.
Great blocks of ten and twenty feet long lay in every direction, with gaps in the walls above them, from which they had been dislodged.
"By George, but they built for time here, when they were at it!"
cried Clarence, looking round him with admiration.
"Yes," replied Ned.
"The builders of this place knew something about the pyramids."
It was all of the massive, square, and Egyptian style of architecture: walls with heavy abutments at the bases; oblong narrow slits for windows and embrasures; wide spaces which had originally been covered with paintings, now only showing in undecipherable patches; massive upright slabs for pillars, with enormous flat lintels.
At intervals on the tops of the outer walls which enclosed this court were placed watch-towers, of forty and sixty feet in height.
The thickness of the portal through which they had passed was twenty feet at the base and about ten at the top, as nearly as they were able to calculate from below.
An open gateway within the most massive of the buildings attracted their attention, but before venturing to explore its dark cavity, Ned formed his company into a close square; then, bidding them wait and watch, he ran over to the wall on the other side, and, climbing it by some steps, he stood on the esplanade with about five feet of wall in front of him.
Then as he looked over he uttered a cry that quickly brought Fred, Clarence, and Cocoeni to his side.
They were overlooking a vast desert that spread far as the eye could take in, as bare and tawny as the great Sahara.
This wall had been built upon a giddy precipice, without a break or a ledge.
As they stretched over they could have dropped a stone without striking anything until it reached the bottom, four thousand feet at least from where they stood.
The air was bracing, and would have been cool, only for the intense waves of heat that were wafted up from the burning sands.
"Here terminates our journey, I expect, Ned?"
said Fred, in mildly interrogative tones.
Ned had pulled out his field-glass, and was scanning the far-distant horizon through it, therefore he did not answer at once.
It was a splendid instrument, and of exceptionally far-reaching power of lens.
"Tell me, Fred and Clarence, what you see over there?"
he asked, handing the glass to his companions.
"Look carefully before you speak, and let Cocoeni have a peep as well first, before you open your mouths."
When Fred had looked through it for some moments he handed the glass to Clarence, who in his turn gave it to Cocoeni in silence.
Then the three friends glanced at each other dubiously.
"Well, Cocoeni, you say first what you saw."
"What white man calls mirage, and black man calls devil-land," replied Cocoeni, grimly.
"Well, but describe this mirage."
"I saw trees and water and big houses same as this here, all shimmering in the air."
"Yes; but they were only in one part of the horizon--to east and west there was nothing but sand."
"That is so, baas."
"And what did you see, Clarence?"
"Oh, something the same as Cocoeni.
There appeared to be a large lake in one part, with trees and houses on its margin."
"And you, Fred?"
"Oh, I saw the lake, or sea, with the other deceptions," replied Fred.
"But I have seen the same sort of thing in Australia."
"I bet you didn't, Fred, see exactly the same sort of thing out there!"
cried Ned, excitedly.
"Now, you know, the nature of mirages is that they will show up on all sides when they show at all.
Look again, and see if that lake has altered its position, or if it is repeated anywhere else than in the one direction."
After another careful survey, the boys owned, somewhat regretfully, that their leader was right.
The mirage--if it was a mirage--was stationary, and localised to one part only.
"It is no deceptive phenomenon," said Ned, decidedly, as he replaced his glass in its case.
"That is a real lake, and those are substantial buildings, and bona fide trees, or I am a Boer, which is about the last kind of beast I'd like to be."
"Then, I suppose, that means you intend to risk the desert?"
answered Clarence.
"Yes; if we can get down to it.
I reckon we can cross that strip of sand in two or three days at most, and we have water enough to carry us over it."
"But, supposing it is a real lake, that doesn't say it is a fresh-water one," replied Fred.
"The buildings and trees are vouchers for that.
Now let us examine this present hill.
Before we do so, however, we'll climb one of those towers, and find out what is to be seen from there."
Ned crossed the court, where his followers were still standing in square, and entered the doorway of the centre tower on the other wall.
The stairs were still standing, and firm underfoot; therefore they were soon on the upper platform or roof.
Here they could see down the pass which they had come, also two other approaches or chasms in the mountain.
They had likewise glimpses of high bare centre peaks that reached above the lower ridges.
It was a sterile prospect.
Not a tree broke the hard outlines of the ruddy rocks.
They lay baking and bald under the bright, hot rays of the tropical sun.
A large flat-roofed building filled out the centre of this fortification.
It was smaller at the top than the bottom, for the sides sloped outwards as they descended; yet a broad parapet surmounted the top for several feet, projecting from its sides.
The roof was completely covered over, while the walls were pierced with windows and loopholes.
On the farther side of this building they were able to see other walls and towers stretching along to a considerable distance.
"This has been a stronghold to keep invaders from the inhabitants of yonder lake-watered land; and as far as I can see, the necessity for keeping it garrisoned has passed away.
That heap of bones we saw must be the remains of some demolished race of invaders.
I think we may venture with all safety inside this building.
There does not seem to be even a jackal about."
Saying these words, Ned led the way down, and, marshalling his force in double line, he advanced with revolvers in his hands towards the portal.
The walls were of immense thickness, and made quite a long passage, through which they passed silently.
Before them opened an apartment, so spacious that the entire company, with their luggage, only occupied an isolated portion of it.
It had accommodation space for at least five thousand people.
Above their heads the roof rose, misty and indistinct in the feeble light that pervaded this vast hall.
The atmosphere felt cold after the heat outside, so that it chilled them and made them shiver.
Lighted only by those narrow windows and slits, which were placed high up the thick walls, a mystic shadow, like the forest gloom, added to the vastness.
They seemed within a mammoth cavern.
The floor was slabbed with stones, and destitute of furniture, while a thick layer of dust and fine sand deadened the sounds of their footsteps.
For a time no one dare utter a word, so profoundly had that gloomy vastness and deathly silence impressed them.
At last Ned spoke, and at the hollow sound of his voice they all started; it seemed as if the words had been instantly carried away, to be repeated faintly in the roof.
"I wonder what they used this place for?
Look at those figures on the walls."
The walls, which they could now see more plainly than at first, were covered with strange designs of figures and animals--men, with the heads of birds and beasts; warriors in chariots, on horseback, and on foot; captives being driven along.
All the pastimes and pursuits of the builders were here portrayed in colours, in which black, red, yellow, and blue predominated.
These were faded with age, yet, with but few exceptions, in perfect condition as far as the outlines were concerned.
There were no openings along the entire sides, nor, with the exception of the passage by which they had entered, were there any other portals.
But at the far end they could see daylight shining through a number of dislodged slabs, which partly blocked up what appeared to be a much longer passage than that behind them.
As they grew accustomed to the faint light they were able to make out two smaller doorways on each side of the centre passage.
Ned strode boldly, followed by his comrades, to the aperture nearest him.
Inside they found a small chamber; at least, it looked so after the hall.
Yet it was twenty feet wide by nearly thirty long.
It was lighted from the outer side, and at the end was a small doorway, on entering which they found themselves at the foot of a staircase, which led upwards, as they naturally supposed, to other chambers and to the roof.
For the present they deferred the further investigation of this stair, and tried the other door of the hall.
A similar apartment waited them here, with a ceiling of the same height, namely, about eighteen feet.
But at the end they found themselves confronted by a flight of steps leading downwards.
It was wide enough for four men to walk abreast, and in good condition.
Also, although darker than the hall, yet it was fairly well lighted by slits in the wall.
"Ah, this is the road I want to take!"
"Come along with your traps, boys."
They were very soon below the surface of the ground, and traversing broadly cut steps that led them at a downward angle straight towards the face of the precipice overlooking the desert.
They knew when they had reached within six feet from the rock front, from the turn they took, also by the increased light.
This, with sufficient fresh air to keep the tunnel sweet, had been made by perforating loop-holes in the solid rocks.
Ninety-eight steps they counted, as they went downward, of a foot and a half each in depth.
Then suddenly the stairs terminated, while the passage widened out until it formed another great hall underground, of about two-thirds the size of the apartment over their heads.
They stood and looked about them with increased astonishment.
The labour of hewing this immense underground chamber from the solid rock must have been prodigious, unless originally the excavators had found natural caverns here.
But this was not what astonished our heroes, so much as the artistic ingenuity and care which had been expended here.
In the hall above, the severely plain walls had been frescoed by the painter's art.
Here the sculptor had displayed his mystic and religious skill with bold as well as intricate designs.
From floor to ceiling, all along, the walls were carved.
There were also outstanding rose-tinted and white granite massive pillars of colossean and upright figures, with elaborate ornamental capitals on their heads, representing head-dresses of flowers, fruit, and grain, or coiled snakes.
At the feet of these huge figures were other symbols to serve as bases.
As these pillars were carved in almost full relief, they formed deep niches between each, which were shelved up from floor to ceiling with thick ledges, also cut from the rock.
The edges of these shelves were most intricate in their symbolic sculptures.
The ceiling, likewise, was closely covered with designs of a sacred character in bold relief, while even the floor was a mass of smooth and polished carving.
The effect of all this subtle and bold work was extraordinarily rich in the subdued light that filtered in from the one side, making deep and rich shadows.
Never had our heroes looked upon anything so profusely beautiful and mysterious.
Yet it was not the carving only that made them gasp with admiring wonder.
All over the sculptures gleamed sparkles of gold, chased and burnished.
These glittered in all parts, sometimes in broad veins and clusters, in other places in star-like specks or thready lines.
Going over to one of these clusters, Ned discovered that they had not been inlaid, as he at first supposed, but were natural veins of virgin ore, utilised as they occurred, by the cunning artificers.
They were in the centre of what was probably the richest gold quartz mine in the world.
The excavators, satisfied with the wealth which had been already extracted, had carved this monument on the still-teeming mine, thinking to consecrate it probably in this fashion from covetous hands.
There were hundreds of shelves, and the greater number of them were occupied by sarcophagi, also carved elaborately.
Whatever the upper chamber had been used for, the meaning of this place was at once apparent to our heroes.
They had not only discovered a gold-mine, but also a hall of the dead.
In front of them, in the upper end of the apartment, were placed, or rather cut out, like the column, two great statues in a sitting posture, and between them a broad table of polished quartz.
One of these had the body of a woman, with the head covered.
In her right hand was held a pair of scales.
The other was shaped like a man, with the head of a bird, which was turned in her direction.
"This beats all I ever saw," said Ned, in an awestruck whisper.
"We must come here again.
Meantime, we must try to find our way down further."
None of them suggested food, although it had been hours since last they dined.
They were too greatly excited over this strange discovery.
Round the chamber they paced, seeking for an outlet without success.
The only opening they could see was the one down which they had come.
At length Clarence saw, at one side of the table, and close to the feet of the woman statue, a large bronze ring that had been covered over with dust.
"Hallo, boys, here seems something made to lift!
Bear a hand, and see if we can hoist this particular slab."
Several of the Kaffirs leapt forward and pulled at the ring individually without success.
Finding that not even the strongest among them could make the slightest impression, Ned ordered the rope used for the "tug-of-war" to be produced and inserted into the ring.
This was done, and twenty-four of the men took each end of it--twelve to a side--and ranged themselves down the hall.
"Now, steady, lads, and all together--pull."
This was effective at the second pull.
Those watching had the satisfaction of seeing a large slab slowly lift up from the floor until it rose on end, and fell backward with a loud crash.
But their satisfaction was short-lived, for hardly had the echo of the crash ceased, than, with loud yells, the entire company were flying pell-mell towards the stairs in a panic.
From the cavity emerged, with loud hisses and gaping jaws, a number of the largest pythons ever seen out of a drunkard's delirium.
Gorgeous-tinted and shining, they reared out one after the other, trailing their long bodies over the carved floor, until there were at least fifty of them, twenty to fifty feet in length, and with girth enough to have swallowed a buffalo easily.
That they were hungry, and thought feeding-time had arrived, was evident from their motions.
They were losing no time, after their preliminary stretch, in making for the staircase where Ned and his followers were crushing together.
Cocoeni and several of the Kaffirs recovered their presence of mind first.
Instantly facing round, they discharged their weapons at those nearest, while the others followed suit, their courage returning at the sound of the shots.
Blatter went rifles and revolvers into that advancing mass, turning them into a wriggling confusion, and filling the hall with smoke and startling echoes.
It was a horrible and blood-curdling sight to see those monstrous serpents interlacing on the floor, and dyeing it with their loathsome gore, after some of the smoke cleared.
The effluvium, also, which exhaled from them was most noxious and sickening.
Many were slain, although their bodies still writhed and twisted about with horrible contortions.
But more were issuing from that rashly opened aperture.
"That slab must be closed somehow, or we shall never be done with this beastly work," shouted Ned.
"All the pythons in Africa seem to have been preserved in that vault.
Who is game to help me to shut down that trap?"
He made a desperate spring forward as he uttered the words, and ran, followed by the rest, right amongst the horrible mass.
Revolvers, spears, and axes did the rest of the battle.
They were not difficult to disable, although loathsome to feel and smell.
And now that the men had got over their first surprised panic, they tackled the enemy with quick eyes and deft strokes.
Ned, Cocoeni, and two other Matabeles reached the stone, and managed to raise it and drop it once more into its place with a bang, cutting through the middle a couple of out-coming snakes.
While they did so, the rest hewed, stabbed, and shot for all they were worth.
In five more minutes the last of the sibilant hisses were silenced, and only the sound of lashing bodies could be heard.
Then, while they reloaded their weapons, they paused, waiting for the smoke to evaporate, while they cleared, with their rifle-butts and spears, the wriggling abominations from their vicinity.
Before this could be done, however, many a shiver passed over them as they felt a slimy tail convulsively grip round their legs.
A slash with their knives relieved them of these unpleasant embraces, but the sensation was decidedly nauseous and creepy.
Slowly the gunpowder smoke grew thinner, as it escaped through the air-hole slits and up the staircase.
It still, however, hung too closely around them to see the opposite walls.
All at once, as they listened for fresh hisses, a sound like coughing, outside their circle, struck upon their ears.
Snakes do not cough, although they can make a noise.
Some human beings, with lungs less used to saltpetre fumes than theirs were, must be in the hall at the far end, as yet unseen.
Strangers here meant probable enemies.
Instantly and instinctively they drew together and formed a square, with their rifles up to their shoulders.
As they bent forward, peering into the sulphur-charged mist, those facing east and west beheld a mass of indistinct forms clustered before them.
Those facing north and south saw hazy figures gliding from pillar to pillar.
Three more minutes, and the vapour had cleared sufficiently for them to grasp that they were surrounded completely, by a foe clothed in some kind of scaly armour.
They waited in grim silence for the fumes to clear thoroughly, so that they might know what force they had to encounter.
At last they could see the four corners of the walls, also the open passages by which the crowd had entered so noiselessly.
Two of the pillars at each end had been rolled aside, leaving gaping cavities where they had stood.
Facing them, and leaning on their spears, stood a double row of upright figures, with metal helmets on their heads and chain armour on their bodies, arms, and legs.
Round the waist of each was a short kilt of leopard-skin, which reached to the knees.
They were well-formed warriors, nearly all of them as tall as the Kaffirs.
Their skins were of a warm copper tint, with dark eyes and long flowing tresses.
Not a beard was amongst them, while their features were fine and pronounced, with straight noses, full lips, and oval faces.
They were determined-looking and fierce, yet unmistakably youthful and handsome.
Ned glanced from their faces to their breast-plates, and then he shouted--  "Boys, after the snakes we have a regiment of amazons to face.
Oh, come, this is hard lines!
We cannot fire on women, even though they are amazons.
We must manage them in some softer way, or else capitulate with our best grace."
His words broke the spell of silence that had been upon them.
Clarence and Fred burst out laughing, while the Matabeles and Basutos grinned broadly and displayed their ivories.
They did not drop their weapons, however, for the amazons had advanced a step closer with their spears ready for charging, and they did not look at all amiable.
Still Ned thought he discerned upon their faces more of wonderment, blended with some admiration, than anger, as they scanned the splendid semi-nude figures of his men.
He gave the order to ground arms and stand easy.
For himself, he handed his rifle to the one standing next to him, and, pushing his revolver back into his belt, he stepped from the ranks, and held out his open hands to show that he was unarmed.
For a moment he paused there, the women watching his smiling face suspiciously; then, at a word, they lowered their spears.
He took another step away from his men.
As he did this, a young and extremely handsome woman advanced towards him, also with open hands.
She was more richly armoured than the others, from which he concluded that she must be an officer.
She did not answer his smile, although she had laid aside her weapon, but came forward, with flashing eyes and curling lip, until she stood opposite him; then she scanned him over so critically until he flushed to the temples.
The other amazons stood watching, evidently with keen interest.
Ned was thinking.
Was she about to embrace him?
It looked as if she were, for she began to crouch like a cat getting ready for a spring, her elbows close to her side, and her palm held upwards.
Then, just in time, her intention flashed upon him.
She had taken his attitude as a challenge to a single duel of wrestling, and had accepted the invitation.
He had only time to utter an exclamation and step backwards, when she made the leap and closed in.
She was an adept at the game, as Ned could feel by the way she tried to slip her arms under his, but so was he.
Quick as lightning he got one arm under, while she managed to do the same with him, and then the trial of strength and agility began.
They were equal as far as grip was concerned, but the chivalry of our hero placed him at a disadvantage.
He could not forget her sex, and dreaded crushing her if he put out his full strength.
All the same, he wished she had been a man, for she was a most worthy adversary; also, if he spared her, she had no such feelings for him.
He felt she was in deadly earnest, and was striving her utmost to break his back or neck.
As he said afterwards, Pylea was a vicious cat at wrestling.
He might have thrown her, or tripped her up, had he liked, for he was as hard as iron, and had the advantage of weight, although she was no mean weight herself.
But he preferred the waiting and eluding game, so together they strode backwards and forwards for full five minutes without either of them losing their feet or grip.
Then gradually, as her hot and panting breath struck down his neck, he worked his hand down the links, until he had her round the small of the waist.
Next instant, by a quick jerk, she was off the ground and in his power.
Had she been only a man, he would have thrown her without compunction over his back, but as it was, he placed her gently on the ground, and pinned down her arms.
It is sad to relate, yet as he did this with all the gentleness possible, under the circumstances, she showed her sex by making her white teeth meet in the fleshy part of his arm.
She had wrestled fairly up to this moment of defeat, and Ned was too much of a man to resent that last touch of vanquished ire.
He looked at her reproachfully as he rose to his feet.
As he did this, the tears rushed into her eyes, while she covered her face with her hands, as if ashamed as well as beaten.
"Wrestling must be a favourite pastime with these warlike ladies," murmured Ned, as he wiped his streaming face on his handkerchief.
that was a hot bout, and no mistake."
For a moment after he had released the amazon, silence reigned over the spectators, then a loud cry of admiration rose from the ranks to which the conquered one belonged.
This proved at least that they might be fierce, but they were at least generous foes; also that they had witnessed what evidently was a novelty to them.
"What sort of men are raised in their nation, I wonder?"
muttered Ned, looking anything but pleased at this demonstration.
"The women are all right, and a little more so, like our gymnastic girls; but they are evidently not used to muscular men, or perhaps these are so big that they are astonished to see the like of me doing this slight trick."
While he still mopped his face and his followers stood waiting on the next development, sixty of the women ran out of the ranks from different sides, unarmed, and with animated gestures and a torrent of scornful words, challenged the square to a similar contest.
The language sounded strange yet musical in their ears, but the bright flashing eyes, curling red lips, and defiant actions made their meaning clear.
With a burst of guttural laughter, Cocoeni and fifty more of his companions stripped themselves of all but their waist-bands, and stood forth to gratify the wrestling-loving viragoes.
"Deal softly with them, lads, yet beat them," cried Ned, seeing what was about to take place.
He had an instinctive feeling that it was necessary for their future safety that these amazons should be taught a lesson, yet he did not wish any of them hurt, and these Kaffirs were mighty fellows.
"Never fear, baas," answered Cocoeni, laughing softly.
"We shall not lose our tempers, but we will show these girls that they have the arms of men round them."
The challengers looked at the satin skins and muscular forms of those sable heroes with renewed cries of admiration, which mightily pleased their masculine vanity.
There was no timidity or fear, however, in the regard of the amazons.
They were evidently only delighted at meeting with such antagonists.
As the Matabeles and Basutos also examined the opponents opposite to them, their eyes began to sparkle with feelings more ardent than rivalry.
Here stood women worth fighting with or for.
They had no longer any dread of treachery, for the others had laid down their weapons and shields, and were busy discarding all superfluous encumbrances, such as helmets, shoulder-coverings, and ornaments.
They were also rolling and tying up their loose tresses.
It was evident that they intended having a turn also after the present bout was over.
As far as numbers were concerned the amazons counted about two to one of Ned's force, therefore he saw that he would be likely to have another engagement presently.
Thinking on the possibility of this, he stripped himself of his jacket, hat, and bandolier, tightened his waist-belt, and began to roll up his shirt-sleeves.
His example was followed by Fred and Clarence.
As he was thus engaged near the girl he had conquered, who still crouched at his feet with bent and covered face, one of the amazons came over to him with a spear in her hand.
This weapon she held out to him, pointing at the same time to the prostrate figure, with a significant gesture, which said plainly--  "She is yours by right of conquest; kill her."
Ned recoiled horrified at this savage suggestion.
Refusing the spear, with a motion of disgust, he stooped and gently lifted the fallen one to her feet, patting her at the same time kindly on the shoulder.
She appeared dazed for a moment at this unexpected clemency, then suddenly she seized his hand and kissed it passionately.
Ned laughed awkwardly and blushed scarlet; then, to cover his confusion, he turned to watch the combatants.
For the next two hours that richly carved hall of the dead was the field of as tough yet bloodless a contest as ever had been waged anywhere.
All had observed the incident, and understood the meaning of that spear offer.
These amazons were as brave and generous as chivalrous soldiers could be, but mercy to the vanquished was clearly not one of their virtues.
They neither would spare nor expect to be spared.
This being the condition of defeat, every one exerted themselves to the utmost, and finished the conflict as quickly as possible.
The amazons were strong, lithe, and full of tricks, but the men acted warily, and gave them no advantage.
The result was that sex conditions told, and the women, without exception, were put hors de combat.
By the time it was over, however, Ned and his followers felt that they had done hard enough work for that day at least.
They were hot, hungry, furiously thirsty, and completely fagged out.
So were the women, but not so much as they were, since they had taken double turns.
They flung themselves down on the cool stones, steaming and panting, while a number of the amazons who had rested left the chamber.
The mangled snakes still jerked about their severed links at the other end, for the conflict had been carried on at the lower end of the chamber.
While they sprawled about in all sorts of free and unstudied attitudes, the amazons, who had recovered their breath, watched the brawny proportions of their rivals with undisguised admiration and respect.
Many of them had received heavy bruises and falls, but this they did not seem to care much for.
They were considerably dishevelled also, but woman-like, they at once started tidying and redecorating themselves, while they watched with friendly eyes their rough conquerors.
Presently those who had left the chamber returned, accompanied by about a dozen of degraded-looking, ugly black dwarfs, who carried heavy jars and dishes laden with food.
At the smell of the roasted meat and boiled pulse, our heroes and their followers at once sat up and prepared themselves for the welcome feast.
The girls now clustered round them, a couple to each man, and waited upon them assiduously, with the most hospitable smiles and gestures.
The conquered were particular in selecting those who had mastered them to serve.
They kneeled on each side, and while one proffered water in large cups of curiously shaped and carved metal, the other picked out the choicest pieces from the platters, and fed them from their fingers like young birds.
They were all friendly now, chattering away in that unknown liquid language with wonderful volubility, and showing their white teeth in the most bewitching smiles.
They seemed to be delighted with their new masters, for they showed that they recognised them now as such.
Ned and his followers also were more than satisfied with their present position.
Yet these amazons displayed by many signs that they had a purpose in view, and no desire to linger or leave their new friends in this sculptured hall.
With a few words of stern and terse command, the leader, who was Ned's first antagonist, pointed shudderingly to the mutilated snakes.
At these orders the repulsive-looking dwarfs went over, and lifting up the quivering masses, removed them by the upper end, and afterwards brought sand and covered up the blood.
As soon also as our heroes had satisfied their hunger and thirst, they all rose, and dividing the packages amongst them, led the way towards the two apertures in the lower end.
Ned and his men had no objection to these new attendants carrying the loads, since they were forced to trust them now.
But they stuck tenaciously to their weapons and ammunition.
They entered a narrow passage outside the column, and after pacing along it towards the cliff face, they began once more to descend.
Fifty steps in one direction along the punctured inner side of the cliffs, brought them to a flight of steps at the opposite angle.
When that other fifty was reached, another flight at the first angle met them, and so on, until they had descended three thousand of these steps.
It was a fatiguing journey after their heavy exertions, for the amazons hurried them along without a pause.
They were either in great haste, or else did not wish any more investigations to be made of this underground region.
The light was growing fainter also, as it was nearing sunset, yet our heroes were able to see, at each turn of the stairs, passages leading into other chambers.
From several of these, as they got near the bottom, they heard a clanking sound, as if miners were at work.
"I say, boys," said Ned, "do you hear?
They are still working this gold-mine.
What about the mirage now?"
Since meeting these female warriors our heroes had no longer any thought of turning back.
There seemed no danger of perishing from want or thirst.
As for other dangers, they were quite ready to encounter these.
"This is an adventure and no mistake.
I guess we are bound to see some strange things before long," answered Fred, excitedly.
It was nearly dark before they crossed the last step and found themselves once more on level ground.
Before them spread a wide and long apartment with a huge fire burning in the centre.
A strong menagerie-like perfume greeted their nostrils along with the more pleasant odours of cooking.
As they entered, a wild chorus of savage yells echoed through the vault.
A number of slender and undersized figures moved about.
Some were clad in white robes, others with only waist-bands round their waists.
From a square, wide, and high portal halfway down, and on the same side by which they had descended, the last orange glow from the setting sun fell in a long slanting line upon the sand floor.
They had, at length, come down to the desert.
Ned and his followers looked round them curiously, while the friendly amazons placed their packages all together.
There were bold and somewhat rude carvings on some portions of the wall, but otherwise it was left rough hewn.
It was, however, quite as roomy, although not so lofty, as the upper hall which they had first seen.
There were rugs and skins flung down at different parts on the sands, with armour, weapons, and other articles of use.
This was evidently the present barracks of these amazons.
The lower parts of the inner walls were lined with recesses strongly barred.
In these were caged a number of leopards.
These leopards were separated from each other by intervening partitions.
Apparently it was their feeding-time, as these half-nude figures were moving about from cage to cage with huge junks of flesh, which they pushed into the cages.
The amazons went round the cages, inserting their hands between the bars and stroking the animals.
As they did so, the wild roaring which had greeted their appearance sank into gratified and loud purrs.
Pointing to the spread skins, the women signed for the adventurers to rest.
Gladly our tired heroes availed themselves of the permission.
Here, stretched out at their ease, they could observe their surroundings.
They saw the amazon leader, with a few of the others, go over to the white-robed figures, and then began an earnest conversation.
A little explanation was evidently given to account for the presence of the strangers; but, as far as Ned could make out, the warriors were mistresses, and confined themselves mostly to giving orders, which the others listened to meekly, and bowed their heads obediently.
In a little while the half-naked figures approached the fire and lighted some torches at it, which they stuck into clamps round the wall.
This threw more light on the scene.
The sun had now gone down, and darkness was beginning to hide the desert, which Ned could see through the open portal from where he lay.
The semi-nude figures now approached, and, kneeling down, began to take off the boots of him and his comrades; after this they washed their feet and covered them again.
It was all most delightful and pleasant, and Ned was glad that the amazons did not attempt this task.
They apparently were engaged making their own toilets during this time.
While allowing the slaves to manipulate, he looked at the white-robed forms.
They were engaged in various departments of duty.
Some were baking bread-cakes, others cooking various dishes, and several were hard at work plaiting and dressing the tresses of the amazons.
They were meek visaged, and had their heads shaved, yet, somehow, although so small and spiritless, they seemed to belong to the male sex.
Another feed was under way of a more substantial description than the last.
As the savoury fumes stole into their nostrils, they once more began to find themselves prepared for it.
Presently it was ready, and this time the ladies shared it with them.
While they were eating and drinking, four of the white-robed figures sat near and played on harps.
It was a plain supper of roasted and stewed game garnished with garlic, boiled rice, with maize and lentil cakes.
For vegetables they had leeks and yams, while bananas, figs, and grapes served for dessert.
A delicious, light-tasted, but rather heady wine was given to them along with the water, which was pure and sweet.
This they took sparingly of, yet it quickly sent them all off to sleep.
Ned woke soon after sunrise the next morning, and before his companions.
Fred, Clarence, Cocoeni, and the other Kaffirs were doing their best to eclipse the howling of the caged leopards with their snoring.
The slaves were there, also the bakers, cooks, hairdressers, and general all-round men.
But the amazons were absent.
The general practitioners of the comb and harp were filling in their spare time by whipping the slaves with cruel-looking thongs, as they went about their drudgery.
The faces of those clean-shaven, undersized, and lean, white-robed men still looked as expressionless and meek as long-imprisoned convicts usually do.
They had likewise the same unwholesome waxiness of complexion; buff-coloured wax their thin cheeks and narrow foreheads were, with purply close-set lips, and long, deep-placed, lustreless blue-black eyes.
But, although they did not smile nor sneer, nor ever lose their sad gentleness of expression, they cut pitilessly into those naked black shoulders with their hard flagellators, and often out of ruthless wantonness.
The slaves were a square, dwarfish, and repulsive set of bestial wretches, yet Ned began to view these placid and soulless tormentors with greater repugnance and loathing; they were like venomous, icy, and cowardly yellow snakes.
Their features, however, were sharp and fine, and of a sameness in profile if cast from one mould.
He had seen those calm, bird-like, relentless profiles in prints of the Egyptian sculptures and paintings, with long, straight noses, protruding and short upper lips, and receding small chins,--the true signs of a used-up decadent race.
Sick with watching these methodical and pitiless strokes, he walked through the portal and out a few yards into the yielding sand, then he looked back and up the precipice.
He could see the broken walls at the top, over which he had peered yesterday.
The rising sun was shining upon them, and they gleamed whitely against the soft azure.
The precipice also glistened with its variegated blush and yellow rose-leaf tints, with the darker veins of grey and ochre.
It was smooth and ridgeless, while the loopholes were too narrow to be seen from where he stood.
The flat lintel and obelisk-like sides of the doorway had been cut a few feet into the rock, so that the precipice protruded.
The intaglio slabs were covered with hieroglyphics and figures.
His eyes wandered to the sides, and here he met a surprise,--a long line of gaily painted and anciently shaped chariots stood ranged, like bathing-machines, against the base of the cliff.
He had never seen a chariot outside of pictures before, therefore these interested him vastly, with their carving, gilding, and bright colours.
After looking minutely over one of them, he turned round to scan the desert.
Away in the distance rolled a low cloud of dust, through which the sun shone upon glittering metal.
It was approaching rapidly, and as he watched resolved itself into the two hundred mail-clad amazons, who were coming in at a swift run and in a straight line.
Very soon they were within a hundred yards of him, with flushed faces and heaving breasts.
There they stopped suddenly, and, forming rapidly into eight deep, marched steadily towards where he stood.
He learned afterwards that they had been out for the past four hours, doing their customary morning exercise of running, which was twenty miles before breakfast.
This was to keep them in good condition, and one of their obligations as warriors.
With friendly smiles they marched past him and entered through the doorway without other recognition.
Following them slowly, he saw them pass through and into a door which he had not observed the previous night.
He found his followers awake when he got in, and busy washing their faces in basins, which the slaves were holding for them.
As this was exactly what he would have asked for, could he have made his desires known, he straightway proceeded to follow their example.
"I expect they have tanks, or some way of catching and keeping the rains from above," said Ned, seeing that they were so lavish with the precious fluid.
A distant sound of splashing, accompanied by female voices, from behind that curtained door answered his surmises.
Very soon afterwards the amazons appeared once more, accoutred, and with fresh-coloured faces and damp flowing tresses.
Breakfast was ready, and without ceremony they fell to, and hastily did full justice to it.
The next operation which our heroes watched, but could not help with, was the liberating and harnessing of the fierce leopards to the chariots.
Each amazon led out her own trained animals, like dogs in leash, and strapped two to each chariot.
The fair leader now split her regiment, leaving half behind to mount guard over this mine, while the other hundred and twenty distributed the packages of our heroes amongst the chariots.
They were ready to start.
Ned, the leader, chose to share her chariot, and the others picked out their conquerors and beckoned them to enter.
With a swift, cat-like bound the leopards went off, while from the broad wheels the sand flew up, and left behind a trail of yellow clouds that quickly blotted out those left behind.
The passengers, not being used to chariot-riding, kneeled on the packages, and hung on to the side-rails frantically.
But the drivers stood, like rocks, on their feet, with the reins round their waists, held there by a ring, and their arms and hands free to use their whips or weapons.
Over each shoulder was slung a strap filled with long shafts and a black palm bow.
They never slackened speed, for the leopards seemed tireless.
They ran softly yet swiftly, hour after hour, while the sun rolled overhead with scorching force.
The burning glare from the hot sand was blinding, and the helmets and chains must have been almost unbearable, yet the hardy drivers did not appear to feel them.
They leaned forward with flashing eyes and streaming tresses, and still urged their willing animals on.
Once during that day they roused a pack of fine lions, who bounded after them.
Ned saw one of these fierce beasts nearing the chariot, and shouted to his driver to warn her of the danger.
His rifle was between his knees, loaded, but it was of no more use to him than a stick.
He dare not relax his grip of the side at the rate they were going, or he would have fallen out.
The dauntless girl looked back, at his cry, with a merry laugh.
Then, gripping her whip with her teeth, she slipped off her bow, and tightening the string, took out one of her shafts, and fitted it.
Swiftly turning half round, she bent the bow until the arrow-head was touching it, then the string smote the bow with a twang like a loud harp-note.
Ned watched the shaft, as it sped with a whistle through the air.
Straight it flew towards the lion, and buried itself in his flaming eye.
It was a splendid and deadly, though it looked a careless aim.
With one leap upwards the lion rolled over and over, half burying himself in the loose sand in his death-throes.
When Ned looked from the lion to his slayer he saw her standing, with her bow once more in its place and the whip in her hand, standing and looking forward, while she drove for all she was worth.
The other lions were treated in the same fashion by the rest of the drivers.
Evidently they had nothing to learn in the ancient craft of archery.
That afternoon, however, as they rested for an hour, Ned found an opportunity of showing what his rifle could do.
Yet, after her archery feat, he did not feel too conceited over his most modern of death-dealing implements.
The desert appeared infested with lions of the fiercest order.
Hardly were they seated when one appeared at a little distance.
It was within shooting distance, but too far off for her shaft, so, while she was leisurely tightening her bow-string, he took a steady aim and fired.
At the report she started up with unfeigned alarm, but, quickly recovering herself, she sat down again with stoical composure.
It was a long shot, but he did not need to repeat it.
The lion was done for.
When she saw this, she displayed the most lively and childish interest about his rifle.
Pointing to a great vulture in the sky, she signed him to shoot it.
While he was taking aim, she put her fingers into her ears; then, when she saw the bird drop headlong, she cried with wonder.
He had raised her admiration in a new direction.
All through that night and the best part of the next day they raced.
They only took three or four half-hours' rest during this time, while they ate a few dates and drank a mouthful of water.
As for the leopards, they got nothing except a few small cakes during those short breathing spaces.
Our heroes were forced to own that for swiftness and endurance the trained leopard beats both horse and dromedary for desert travel.
At midday the distant city and lake appeared on the horizon, and by four o'clock they had passed between the first of the palm trees, and left the desert behind.
Ned, Fred, and Clarence had by this time become somewhat used to their uncommon and ancient surroundings.
The biblical and archaeological chariots, armour, costumes, and features had startled them when first seen.
Now they were only driving toward, what they expected to find, a specimen page of prehistoric illustrations, preserved in the heart of that Africa from which those decayed nations had sprung.
Luxury and corruption caused the fall of Rome, Carthage, Greece, Assyria, Egypt, and the countless races that preceded these chronicled nations.
When Melchizedek walked the earth, and Lot pleaded with the angels, mankind was old and worn out with self-indulgences.
When Noah vainly preached to the sons of men, they had become dilettante, idle, cynical, and luxurious; refined in art, cruelty, and callous vice; enervated to the last degree, and barren of all impulse.
This has always been and always must be the results of ultra-civilisation.
The second step from utter barbarism which deals with conquest and cruelty, is but the beginning of the end of all nations, ancient and modern.
The implacable order of nature is to grow and decline.
Matter must change, although its constituents are immortal.
The road from the desert to the city was broad and straight.
Fifty chariots could drive abreast through the centre, leaving the side-paths for the pedestrians.
A double line of huge palm trees fringed this wide highway, and cast violet shadows on the side-walks.
Between the trunks they could see rich and carefully irrigated fields of grain and vegetables--maize, rice, manioc, wheat, pulse, yams, and pine-apples, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic, with shady groves of sugar cane and bananas at the corners, and hedges all around of vines.
The glistening of water in the regularly cut canals and lotus-covered ponds, with the fringes of papyrus reeds and varied-tinted blossoms and flowers, made a delicious picture of rural prosperity and radiance.
Regular symmetry and mathematical order were the predominant features of these fertile plains, with their straight canals and square ponds.
Not a foot of soil was wasted nor left to run wild.
It was all under cultivation, like a carefully tended garden.
Dark-skinned and semi-nude slaves of both sexes crowded these fields and plantations, while the same class of white-clad, yellow-skinned, and diminutive overseers walked about and plied the whip remorselessly, yet without excitement.
Our heroes longed to ask questions, for they were bursting with curiosity, and they inwardly resolved to learn the language as soon as possible, if they were permitted to live here long enough.
Already they had mastered the native terms for water, wine, food, chariots, leopards, lions, spears, helmets, and armour.
This was a fair beginning.
As for Cocoeni and his fellow-Kaffirs, they were devoting themselves most assiduously to the pursuit of their conquests, and, as they showed by their ardent glances, conquerors also.
They appeared to be progressing fairly well, considering that looks were their only means of communication at present.
As they drove along, eight abreast, they noticed that they were causing a considerable stir amongst the pedestrians and other natives whom they met, overtook, or passed.
They were also watching with great interest these inhabitants.
They could distinguish the men by their small stature and general spiritless condition.
Woman seemed in this land to be the superior animal, both in stature, deportment, and position.
Armed amazons, on high-spirited horses, cantered or dashed past them, bestriding their beasts man-fashion.
They were all splendidly costumed, and many of them very beautiful.
Some drove chariots with trained lions and leopards as well as zebras and horses.
It was a dazzling and picturesque sight that impressed our heroes deeply.
Elephants also paced the roads with their laden howdahs gaily caparisoned; others, again, drew heavy waggons.
Oxen trailed along strange-looking carts and waggons, while the footpaths teemed with life.
The men alone wore white robes.
Numbers of these were about, carrying or leading children as mothers do in other countries.
Some had slaves to do this for them, and when they were so far blest, they carried the invariable whip, which they used unsparingly.
The chariots had now passed the fields and farm buildings, and were approaching the city.
Massive buildings and walls began to appear, with exquisite gardens and artificial terraces, from which wide steps led down to shady walks and fairy ponds.
Vine tendrils hung over the walls, and formed delicious avenues.
Ornamental trees and obelisks reared out of the under herbage.
Mighty baobabs showed centuries of growth.
Monkeys swung from branch to branch.
Ibises, pelicans, and flamingoes were everywhere.
Between the spaces of those gardens and mansions, they had glimpses of the great lake that supplied the fertility of this highly cultivated region.
On its surface they could see barges floating or moored to the embankment.
Here were quays, with pillars and steps, also crowded with humanity and animal life.
Before them reared a many-columned arch, with battlemented walls on either side, and an avenue of sphinxes leading up to it.
They rolled through these, and then they were within the city, with its huge buildings, pillars, obelisks, stairs, fountains, awnings, arches, crowded side streets, and varied bazaars and shops.
Our heroes felt abashed before these sublime, living tokens of a civilisation supposed to have been for ages extinct.
The rain-season had come and gone, which meant that seven months had elapsed since our heroes were driven into the city of Ra-bydus.
They understood a good deal, by this time, about the people and language of Karnadama, for so the land was named, as the city was called Ra-bydus.
During these months they had been treated as honoured visitors; yet it was plainly intimated to them that they would not be permitted to depart until her majesty Isori had seen them.
No one else could treat with them, or decide what course to pursue respecting them, during the great queen's absence; therefore they were held in a kind of honourable captivity.
They were lodged in princely quarters and all together.
The regiment of young amazons who had discovered them were placed in charge of them--to attend upon them, escort them when they went abroad, and were made responsible for their safety and presence.
No one interfered with their actions so far.
They were free to walk, drive, or ride about the extensive city, provided some of their bodyguard went with them.
They could go out hunting, with the same escort, sail on the lake, and view the land as far as it could be viewed between sunrise and sunset.
But they were expected to be within the city walls when the gates were closed.
Only in this sense were they treated as captives.
Ned and his followers did not find the life they led at all irksome.
It might become so in time, but they had no intention of staying here much longer.
The queen was on her way home to her capital; when she returned they would either get permission to go, or else take French leave.
Meantime they were having pretty much the same kind of time as blue-jackets have when they get ashore in a foreign port.
They were the heroes of the hour, and were made welcome everywhere, except to the temple.
From that sacred portal they were most rigidly excluded.
Tutors were provided to teach them the language of the higher classes, so that they might be able to converse with her majesty when she arrived.
She had heard about their advent, and these were her orders, sent by special messengers.
Like President Kruger, no other language but her own people's was permitted at court.
Our heroes made rapid progress in their studies.
While the country was swamped, and the hot rains made the cool interiors of these the most pleasant places to pass the time, they had spent their spare time with the teachers, listening to their explanations, and mastering the meaning and sounds of their vocabulary.
The Matabeles and Basutos, also, were apt pupils in the oral part of the instructions.
As soon as they could make themselves understood, however, they discarded the male teachers, and took the rest of their instructions from their amazon guards.
Ned, Fred, and Clarence went further.
They practised the letter-writing, which was like shorthand, to the ordinary hieroglyphic carvings on the walls, and only practised by the educated class.
They also asked many questions respecting the history, myths, and habits of the people they were amongst.
In this way, and by keeping their eyes and ears open, they acquired a vast amount of knowledge in a short space of time.
The Karnadamains were a remnant of the older race, who had fled from Egypt at the time of the invasion of the Shepherd Kings.
Like the Israelites, they had wandered far and encountered many vicissitudes before settling down on this remote and central portion of Africa.
The history of their wanderings and early rulers was comprised largely, like that of the Greeks, of legend and myth.
They still retained the principal features of their ancient religions-- that of animal-worship.
The serpent, the crocodile, the cat, ibis, and other animals of certain kinds were considered sacred, and rigidly protected.
To kill one of these marked animals, either wantonly or accidentally, was a sacrilege, the punishment for which was death.
When our heroes learnt this, and remembered their indiscriminate slaughter of the pythons, they felt themselves in a mighty perilous position should any of their friends, the amazons, betray them.
Ned took an early opportunity of sounding Captain Pylea on the subject.
She, however, laughingly reassured him, and told him to be under no apprehension.
Her subordinates were soldiers, not informers; while, as for the slaves who had removed the carcases, they had been slaughtered to a man, so that they might not speak of what they had seen.
"It was a terrible crime you committed," she added, with a shudder; "for these were of the most sacred order, who are fed with slaves.
But enough were left to swallow up the remains of their brethren and those who might have spoken about it, and we did not see you do the unholy deed."
Ned shuddered to hear the calmness with which she told this atrocity, grateful although he was for her and her comrades' kindness to them.
She was a frank, generous, and courageous young woman, but she had not much womanly mercy in her composition.
"What would you have done, Pylea, if you had been attacked by those sacred--monsters?"
he enquired.
She looked at him with a humorous twinkle in her dark eyes, and touched her bow and spear.
"Afterwards we'd have, as I advise you to do, forgotten all about it."
"Then you don't pin your faith too closely to this venerable creed of yours, Pylea?"
"We expect our fathers, husbands, and brothers to venerate the gods, and attend to their religious, with their other domestic duties, while we do the thinking and the fighting," she answered significantly.
"Do you know, Pylea, you belong to the emancipated sex.
In my land the order is reversed."
"Ah, so it might be in mine, if our men were like you and your followers.
But look at ours.
Could any of them bend my bow or handle my spear?
No; they are too fond of their couches, their pipes, their dinners, and their wines.
They like to spend their time gossiping and making pretty things.
All the exercise they care for is flogging the slaves, so we leave them to what they like best--to look after the children, make poetry, pictures, and pretty carvings, and discuss new dishes, while they fill their empty heads with smoke and strong drink."
"A great number of our men also are fond of the vices you charge yours with, Pylea," answered Ned, laughing at her indulgent contempt of the lords of creation.
"They also drink, smoke, and spend a good deal of time discussing fine dishes and works of art and literature.
When they can paint or carve they get mighty conceited about it; but, as a rule, they don't practise the domestic virtues you speak about."
"Who does this, when there are no slaves?"
"Our women."
"And who does the thinking?"
"Also a good many of our women."
"And the fighting?"
asked Pylea, wonderingly.
"Oh, the men are expected to do that."
"I cannot understand it.
Once on a time, as our men are fond of singing and boasting about in their cups, they say our men could fight.
But we who know them do not believe that, or they would never have fled from the land they ruled over then, according to the legends which they have invented.
No," she continued thoughtfully; "they must always have been as they are, poor, treacherous, mean-spirited cowards, who dare not face a woman, but find a pleasure in tormenting slaves.
They must always have been fond of lying upon litters and couches, of wine and tasty dishes.
They never could have been trusted out of sight--not our men, who are good for nothing honourable, true, or brave."
"Yet you marry them," observed Ned.
"Oh yes; that is the custom.
When we feel ourselves getting too stiff to fight or run, we take a man to keep our house and look after us and our children.
We are always strong enough to make them obedient, and we never expect too much from them.
They are poor things, who do not know what honour and truth are; only a little more to be tolerated than the slaves.
They like to babble about their paltry pastimes, which they call work."
Here were the new woman's ideas and aspirations put into a nutshell, with man the despised placed on his proper footing.
"Once on a time, as our men sing, when they get together and we are out of hearing, their forefathers owned quite a number of wives, as we now own slaves.
But they are never so far gone as to whisper that lie when they return home.
They dip their bald heads in the fountains on the way back before they face us.
This is about the only wisdom which I think they have," said Pylea, softly, as she laughingly left Ned with a military salute.
From what Ned had seen of the amazons, there was not much to fear respecting the python incident, unless Cocoeni and his comrades raised their jealousy.
He resolved to warn them to be careful, and confine themselves strictly to brotherly attentions only.
It would not be wise for them to play at love with those tigresses.
What Pylea had said about the male Karnadamains was all true, as he found out for himself.
They were a cringing, lying, vicious-minded set of self-indulgent sots.
When they could, they slunk off in company, and boasted about their mean vices as if they were actions to be proud of.
A very little of their converse went a long way to sicken and disgust him.
They spoke gently, and were choice in their expressions, for they were critical and refined over details, and artistic in their tastes.
But the details were nauseating, depraved, and loathsome as slimy snakes.
They were vile objects, without one redeeming virtue and with as much human emotion as lizards.
As artists, artificers, and musicians, however, he was forced to give them their meed of praise.
They followed fixed and long-established rules with undeviating and unoriginal fidelity, and never attempted to break from their bonds.
During these months, the queen had been engaged on a warlike expedition with her army, raiding some of the neighbouring tribes to the north.
It was from there that the slaves were procured.
While she was absent, the king, Sotu, who was also her brother, was left at home to look after the royal palace.
Although king, this royal object had no voice in the affairs of the state, or any rule, except over his male subjects, who were, like himself, rigidly excluded from all offices of dignity or authority.
The high officials of the temple were priestesses; likewise all the other positions of dignity were filled by women.
Sotu was king of the minstrels, poets, painters, musicians, sculptors, and cooks.
He was considered to be a great authority on works of art, literature, and the science of the table.
He was a profound gourmand, a most princely drunkard, and a superb judge of tobacco.
He was also considered one of the best chess-players in the kingdom.
Our heroes and their followers had been entertained at the best houses.
They also had spent one evening with the king and a select number of aristocrats whose wives were at the wars.
They had here the opportunity of witnessing the prodigality of an ancient feast with its curious customs.
They also saw evidences of the vast profusion of wealth this nation was possessed of.
The feast was held in a magnificent hall, where stood a throne made of solid gold, covered with fine carving, and encrusted with diamonds.
All round were richly carved and painted pillars.
The walls and ceiling likewise were a mass of painting and plated gilding.
The polished and tessellated floor was covered, ankle deep, with flowers.
The stools were of ivory and gold; the cups, vases, and dishes were also of the same material, and like the throne, sparkling with diamonds.
King Sotu came to the feast garlanded, as were his subjects.
Candles burned in golden candlesticks, and the whole air was filled with perfume.
It was a bachelors' feast, for none of the women would condescend to attend such revels; only slaves, single men, and married ones, who had stolen from their homes, were present, besides our heroes and their followers.
About a dozen of the temple male servants were in attendance to begin the feast with religious ceremonies, and to drag round the mummy-case before the drinking began.
The viands were multitudinous and exquisitely cooked, and while they ate, professional musicians played on various instruments.
It was nearly the last night of liberty for the king and his subjects, and they had made up their minds to enjoy themselves.
Ned and his followers joined in lustily at the eating part of the ceremony, which caused the dull-eyed, yellow-visaged, and purple-nosed royal host almost to forgive them for their excessive strength and stature.
But they completely lost his favour when the serious part came on--the drinking.
Ned sat for a short time, but rose gravely at the close of one of Sotu's favourite stories, and sternly ordered his followers to follow him.
King Sotu was too mean-spirited to resent their going, but after they had departed, and he had swallowed many cupfuls of fragrant wine, he shouted loudly--  "These cannot be men, for they can neither drink nor enjoy a good joke.
We must get rid of them, or we shall not have the life of slaves when our wives return."
Poor King Sotu!
he felt at this moment brave enough to poison Ned and his followers.
But when morning dawned and he tremblingly seized the goblet of wine which his slaves brought him, he quaked in his sandals as he remembered what he had uttered in his festive mood.
A hundred traitor ears had heard the rash words, and he felt sure they would be repeated to their wives.
"Oh, Osiris!"
"If Isori hears of this, I am undone."
After several goblets, he called for his pipe and his whip, and spent the forenoon exercising himself on the backs of his slaves.
Queen Isori had come, and, with her army, was in possession of her royal capital of Karnadama.
She had taken away fifty-six thousand foot and mounted soldiers.
She brought home forty-eight thousand six hundred and twenty able-bodied amazons.
Seven thousand three hundred and eighty dauntless females had found the death they coveted, and over a thousand disconsolate widowers bewailed their fate loudly in the temple courtyards.
It was the custom for those bereaved widowers to mourn in public for their departed spouses, while they prayed that their sins might be overbalanced by their good deeds, in the scales of the gods.
The men of Karnadama were unquestioning slaves to custom, therefore they covered their smooth heads with ashes, wailed, howled, and prayed during the hours appointed for mourning.
Afterwards they met together in those vaults and shades where the wine was kept cool in great clay-baked jars, and drowned their sorrows as deeply as possible.
Bands of them reeled past the garden walls, over which Ned and his companions leaned, watching the bustling midnight streets in the moonlight.
Some of them were trying to sing, others laughed hysterically, while a few of the morbid class, remembering the fine women they had lost, wept feebly while they recounted the departed one's charms.
Ned almost pitied those ownerless and most degenerate goats.
Now that they had seen the great queen, Ned had only one desire left; that was, to lead his men safely from this city, and back to Rhodesia as quickly as possible.
He had passed through every street and alley until he knew each mart and building by heart.
He and his companions had sailed on the lake and along the canals that intersected the city, hundreds of times.
They had watched the men in their open shops: the working jewellers and enamellers, the carvers, sculptors, and painters; the armourers and blacksmiths; the confectioners, bakers, hairdressers, and loom-workers.
These were all quaint and interesting for a time, but they had now grown stale.
They abhorred the men, and did not feel over comfortable with those bold-eyed, combative women, beautiful although most of them were.
The day when Isori returned at the head of her victorious cohorts was the climax to all the brilliant sights they had witnessed; after that procession with the audience which followed were over, Ned began to feel that he could not get too quickly away.
The citizens had been preparing for days to give their queen a right royal welcome.
For the past week advance messengers had arrived every hour, announcing the progress of the army as it approached.
The roads and streets had been crowded with people flocking in, and every house of entertainment was filled.
In answer to his enquiries about the country, he was told that the lake was a hundred miles long by fifty broad.
A wide river flowed from the eastern end of it, and, after a considerable distance, became a boiling cataract that rushed through deep gorges into low marsh and forest lands.
To the north lay a range of lofty mountains, precipitous and densely wooded, where dwelt the dwarfs, who were hunted, captured, and used as slaves.
In their wild state those dwarfs were rather troublesome neighbours, being very numerous and fierce, also using poisoned arrows, the slightest prick of which was fatal.
They were also cannibals of the most repulsive type, torturing their victims mercilessly when they could trap them.
To the west, as in the south, spread vast deserts.
The climate of Karnadama was all that could be desired: our heroes and their followers had never had a day of sickness, even during the long and wet season.
At present the weather was simply delightful.
Diamonds were found in great numbers about half-way between Ra-bydus and the mountains; and, as Ned had seen for himself, their gold-mine yielded them so plentiful a supply that the most ordinary utensils were fashioned from it.
On the plains, which were well watered, dense herds of game roamed about.
Ra-bydus was the only city of importance, although there were several villages scattered over the country.
Queen Isori could call out an army of over a hundred thousand trained amazons.
This, however, comprised the bulk of the female population; on ordinary occasions only the young warriors were kept constantly in arms.
These seldom exceeded ten thousand, who were spread throughout the country in regiments.
The training of these young amazons was exceedingly hard.
From their birth they were constantly exercised like Spartans, until they reached the age of sixteen.
From that age to twenty-five they were constantly in harness, and kept single.
After this age they were allowed to marry and settle down.
Pylea and her regiment were about the same age, having been enrolled together four years previously.
They were then nineteen years of age, and had six years still before them of active service and enforced celibacy.
Ned asked how the population had been kept within limits all these centuries, and was horrified at the reply.
All decrepit and sickly children of both sexes were destroyed at birth.
Every five years a census was taken, and judges sent round to weed out the surplus population.
The victims were selected by the judges appointed, and ruthlessly destroyed by accompanying executioners.
These executioners were appointed from the men, who found their opportunity then of indulging in their natural instinct of cruelty.
Old age, on the male side, was no more respected than childhood, although the women were exempted from this wholesale massacre.
When the husbands became shattered with their vices, they were strangled.
When they grew too obnoxious to live with any longer, they were at once made into mummies.
The women were the judges and sole arbitresses of their fate.
There were no divorces in this wise and loveless community.
If a woman wished to be released from one husband, she made herself a widow, and picked out a younger mate.
As Pylea had remarked, they did not expect too much from the poor things, so completely at their discretion.
They persuaded them to drink, eat, and smoke as they liked, until they were tired of them, then they gave the final wrench to their rope, and ended that domestic worry.
It was a paradise for the fair sex, according to the modern ideas of the new womanhood.
Also the ceremony of the mummy-case being drawn round the feasting halls was no empty or obsolete sign to the men.
"Eat, drink, and enjoy yourselves, for tomorrow you die," was grimly significant to these degraded wretches.
When Ned explained these lop-sided laws and customs to his sable followers, they showed the whites of their eyes, and decided that prudence was the better part of valour when dealing with those fascinating amazons.
All vowed that they would respect the obligations of the service, and not tempt the girls to break their military engagements for their sakes.
"Let us get out of this, baas, before it is too late," said Cocoeni, gloomily, as he recalled some pleasant evenings he had spent under the trees, while trying to master the language with one of the fair guards.
"Yes, we must," added Clarence, almost as seriously--"Even the forest will be healthier for us than this atmosphere."
"As soon as her majesty turns up, I'll make the move," answered Ned.
Our heroes were accommodated with horses on the morning of the arrival, while Cocoeni and his comrades walked.
They were all in fine condition, and looked like giants behind the undersized bystanders.
Pylea and her regiment used their leopard-chariots, and drew up in line along the streets close to the palace to keep the sightseers back.
Ned and his company occupied the post nearest the gates.
Close to his side Pylea stood in her chariot, splendidly attired and looking her best.
"Isori is a great warrior, and the tallest woman of our race, as her mother was before her," she remarked while they waited.
"How old is she?"
"Thirty-three, but she has not lost her swiftness, agility, or strength."
The blare of instruments announced that the conquerors were coming, and soon afterwards the first of the procession appeared.
A thousand richly caparisoned elephants came first, laden with mail-clad warriors.
Behind these came the miserable captives, chained to bars of wood, and drawn along by women on horseback, who cracked their whips over them constantly.
Four thousand of these hideous dwarfs of both sexes had been brought alive from their native haunts.
Following the elephants, they passed the palace walls, while the people looked at them silently.
A large troop of horsewomen came next, and then, at the head of her charioteers, appeared the victorious queen.
Our heroes looked at her as she stood upright in her golden chariot, resting on her massive spear, and they were dazzled at her majesty and the light that blazed from her.
Over six feet in height she stood in her jewelled sandals.
Round her brows wound the royal serpent with uplifted crest, while from behind fell a fringe of blue, red, white, and yellow, barred with gold and crusted with precious stones.
Her breasts and limbs were covered with golden links, while from her shoulders fluttered a rich light cloak, that trailed over the back of the chariot.
Three young lions dragged the car.
She was an imperial woman, with a pale face regularly featured, and great dark eyes that looked out coldly yet steadily as the car slowly glided forward.
Beautiful she was, in the full pride of power and matured strength, with a figure that was matchless.
But it was a face to shudder before.
It was so pitiless, and so icily composed.
No cry of welcome greeted her approach, but a great hush fell over the multitude, that was more impressive.
She was in their eyes a goddess as well as a queen, and all bent their heads and covered their eyes.
Ned and his followers felt decidedly uncomfortable.
As she passed the split lines of Matabeles and Basutos, she shot side glances over their stalwart figures without turning her head.
Then she came to a dead stop opposite Ned, and fixed upon him her steady great black eyes.
He bent his head under that passionless but strangely disquieting stare.
While she stood, from the palace gates came her brother consort, mounted on a white horse, and clad in royal robes that were also blazing with precious stones.
He was taller than the male attendants who accompanied him, but, in spite of his tiara and rich robes, looked the trembling wreck that he was.
Isori looked at her bibulous-faced and purple-nosed consort with a mocking yet indulgent curl of her proud lip, as he bent humbly before her.
Then she said, in a rich, clear voice--  "Hast thou composed many couplets during our absence, Sotu?
I can perceive that thou hast partaken of many cups."
"Immortal one, I have not been idle," answered the poor king, fumbling nervously in the breast of his robe, and wisely ignoring the latter portion of this wifely greeting.
He produced a roll of papyrus.
"I have here a powerful epic to read to you, which I composed in honour of your victory, O brave Isori."
that is sweet.
Keep it till after supper, when thou wilt be in thy best form."
"But, gracious and great one, I hoped to read it here, before our people."
"Ride thou at my side, Sotu, King of Karnadama, and give that roll to one of the servants," she said, with chilling coldness.
Sotu sighed deeply, but yielded, and together the badly assorted pair went between the sphinxes.
About two hours later Ned and his followers were commanded to appear in the presence.
It was a trying ordeal, but our heroes braced up their courage, and stalked through the crowd of courtiers and warriors with erect heads and bulging chests.
They were no slavish male Karnadamains, and they meant to show what men ought to look like; what Britishers are in every land under the sun, except the Transvaal.
It was a much more extensive reception-hall than the dining chamber, vast although that was.
Four lines of columns with lotus capitals supported the flat roof.
The walls were richly covered with varied coloured enamels and plated gold; the floor was of highly polished marble or granite of different tints wrought in subtle patterns of mosaic.
It was a noble throne-room, the vast proportions of which dwarfed the humanity that it was meant to hold.
Five thousand amazonian captains, officers, and female grandees were assembled, besides the priestesses and other civic dignitaries.
There were also the obsequious husbands, in dutiful attendance upon these their imperious mistresses.
These, with the waiting slaves and court musicians, brought up the number present to considerably over twelve thousand.
Yet there were wide spaces between the pillars, and our heroes with their followers were by no means crowded.
The queen and king sat on two thrones, side by side, only her throne was elevated several steps above his, and of a much more gorgeous description.
Fifty broad but shallow steps led from the hall up to the platform on which the thrones were placed.
At each corner of the steps crouched sphinxes, as large as full grown lions, made from beaten gold.
The throne of the queen, with its canopy and dais, were composed entirely of exquisitely carved ivory, encrusted with diamonds.
That of the king was of gold, and, beyond the back, had no canopy.
Queen Isori had been bathed, perfumed, and re-costumed since our heroes had last seen her.
She now appeared more like the conventional woman, and less like the paladin.
Her jet black hair was plaited, and hung down over her shoulders in two thick links, being placed also low on her broad forehead.
Above this sat her serpent tiara.
Her superb arms were naked to the shoulders, except for the jewelled bracelets and wristlets that she wore.
One breast was also bare, the other being covered with golden scales.
Large ear-rings rested against her cheeks, and a wide necklet of diamonds and a Scarabaeus made of emerald, as a pendant, encircled her smooth neck.
From the snake zone round her waist, to her jewelled sandals, fell a robe of diaphanous and changing silk in numerous folds, which, closely plaited as these were, still exhibited her limbs beneath.
In her right hand she held a sceptre of ivory, gold, and jewels, while at her sides kneeled eight slaves fanning her with large peacock feathers.
In front of them crouched two living lions and four leopards.
This was the gorgeous spectacle that greeted our adventurers as they were led by Pylea and her young warriors through the staring crowd of Karnadamains.
They paused at the bottom of the steps to make their best bow, yet they did not attempt to kneel as the amazons were doing.
The queen looked them over leisurely for a full minute, then she slowly extended her arm and lowered her sceptre towards them; as she raised it again, Pylea and her followers stood up.
"You are welcome, strangers, to our court," she said, in that clear, penetrating voice, so distinct yet so coldly smooth.
"Approach, young chief," she added, pointing to Ned, who slowly went up the steps until he was a few feet from the lions and leopards; then he prudently paused.
"We have not beheld a man like you before.
You are young and strong and, we hear, can fight.
We are pleased with you."
Ned bowed and blushed deeply.
"You have a request to make to us.
Reveal it without delay."
Ned cleared his throat, and, in the most flowing terms at his command, said that, having seen her greatness and been blinded by her glory and majesty, he was more than satisfied, and would fain take his departure, with his followers.
Her majesty frowned as she listened to this request, and when it was finished, she said in the some even tones--  "That may be, stranger.
But many of my warriors require husbands, as they will be widows presently."
She looked round the hall with a slight smile, embracing Sotu in that sweeping glance before she stared once more at Ned.
Poor Sotu shrank on his throne, while the male portion of the audience shook visibly.
"We hear you do not spend your leisure hours composing poetry and drinking wine, but that you run and wrestle as our women do.
This is a new experience to us, of mankind, and we desire to see more of it."
Like Napoleon the First, and some other great people, Queen Isori was accustomed to utter her thoughts and wishes without the slightest regard for her audience.
She continued, as clearly and smoothly as before--  "This is our pleasure.
Tomorrow we shall hold a tournament of racing and wrestling.
We choose you as our antagonist, and those of our warriors who have had enough of their present husbands shall select a man from your followers.
If you prevail over us, then we shall be your servants; but if we prevail over you, then you shall be our servants to do with as we please.
I have spoken.
You may kiss my hand."
Yes; she had spoken, Ned thought, as he bent over the shapely ring-covered fingers extended to him, and touched them with his lips.
She had spoken, and placed him in about as bad a fix as Paul Kruger had done.
He glanced at Sotu as he hastily retreated from the vicinity of Isori and her wild beasts.
The king sat in a limp state of collapse most pitiful to see.
His under jaw had fallen, his black eyes showed a bloodshot rim right round them, his saffron cheeks were bleached, and his sharp nose was blue.
Already he felt the fatal noose closing round his thirsty throat.
"King Sotu gives a feast tonight, and we have promised then to listen to his powerful epic.
Those warriors who intend competing tomorrow will be excused from this evening's revel."
Calm and smooth as ever was that dismissal uttered.
Ned and his chums quitted that glorious hall in desperation.
Pylea went with them, with her company.
They were all very silent and grave as they passed along the streets; nor did they utter a word until they were inside the garden walls.
Then Ned could contain his feelings no longer.
"See here, Pylea; I cannot stand this sort of arrangement.
Poor images as King Sotu and the other objects are; this is playing it too rough on them, and on us also.
The stakes are too heavy.
As a good chum, give us your advice."
"Her majesty has snared you, my friends," replied Pylea, sadly.
"Whether you win or lose, she will keep to her purpose; for she never changes.
If you conquer her tomorrow, it will be all the same as if she conquered you, for she has promised nothing.
The king is doomed."
"Then we must escape at once.
Will you help us?"
Pylea sat silent for a long time, looking at her comrades, then she said--  "The queen is immovable, but King Sotu is crafty, and may help us for his own sake.
I dare not aid you by day, and no one can leave the city at night without an order from the queen, backed by her signet ring.
Now, Sotu is his wife's secretary, and he alone dare approach her when she sleeps.
Perhaps he will write this order and steal the ring.
I shall go and see him while the queen is resting after her journey."
Meantime see that your chariots are ready and your leopards well fed, and we will pack up!"
"Do not stir from here till I come.
If I can, I shall bring the king with me."
They had to wait a weary time before Pylea returned with her terror-stricken and dejected male monarch.
As soon as Ned saw him he trailed him inside the hall and poured out a flagon of wine for him.
This the king swallowed at a gulp, then he sank on a couch with a hollow groan.
"Pluck up, your majesty!
If you help us to clear out tonight you'll live to compose many epics, odes, roundelays, and couplets yet.
It only wants an effort, and a little wit."
"It requires more than all these to outwit Isori.
I can write out the order--nay, it is here.
I may also steal the ring while she sleeps if I can only keep sober enough.
But 'tis of this I fear; how can I keep so, having to give a feast?
Why did you come here to trouble me?
Oh, that fatal epic!
It has been my ruin."
"You must resist the amber and ruby for this once if you wish to have many more bowls.
Let me tie this rope round your neck, and it will remind you of your doom if you swallow one cup too much."
"No, thanks!"
cried Sotu, shrinking back.
"I shall go to the feast," said Pylea, quietly, "and guard you as much as I can.
The queen will retire early.
You must leave the feast immediately she goes; for a time, then I shall walk you about in the gardens till you are quite sober.
After you get me the ring you may return to the table and enjoy yourself."
"And what about tomorrow?"
asked the king, fearfully.
"If you do not get the ring tonight, sire, tomorrow you will be dead," answered Pylea, impressively.
"But who will take the blame?"
"I shall," answered Ned.
"I shall write a letter to the queen, and return the ring after I have used it; she will then think that I have taken it.
Only get it first, and then make yourself dead drunk afterwards.
That will remove her suspicion, if she has any respecting you."
"I'll keep sober and do it," cried the king, almost resolutely.
"Afterwards, perchance, I may empty a few goblets to avert suspicion.
Pour me out another cup of wine."
"No more at present," said Pylea.
"Remember what you have to do."
His majesty was used to being controlled by his female subjects, therefore did not repeat his request.
He did not stay long, however, after the arrangements were completed.
The gods had gifted him, as they generally do limited and feeble minds, with an amazing amount of vanity and self-complacency.
He possessed all the composure, easy assurance, and superciliousness of a tenth-rate actor, weak author, singer, or juvenile critic.
He was like the rest of his class, utterly depraved in his habits and instincts; cruel, selfish, crafty, and cold by nature, as well as timid and treacherous.
But he was a most highly educated dilettante, and a proficient in those small imitative arts and sciences which his warlike spouse so openly despised; he could paint well, cook well, and play well, according to the stiff, faulty, and formal laws of a limited past.
Every art, science, and tradition in this country stood still.
Nothing had progressed during the centuries in this land except the women.
In fact, he patronised and dabbled in most of the refined branches of that effete civilisation.
He had no sense of humour.
Shallow-minded and conceited people never are witty, nor can they appreciate a subtile jest.
He affected cynicism, but it was of the feeble and tasteless order.
In matters of tradition and custom he was a dogged believer and slave.
Strength and authority he cringed abjectly under.
Insult passed over him like water from the back of a duck.
When not under the immediate influence of fear, he was as impervious to all other emotions as consuming vanity could make him.
He considered himself as the super-refined salt of the earth, and his wife as a superb animal, who pleased his artistic senses with her matchless charms, and protected him with her strength.
He was supremely satisfied with himself, and also with her, and delighted to speak about and extol her superior points.
As for the other little drawbacks of his self-indulgent existence, his ignoble place and loss of dignity, he did not feel any more shame in the servitude than a flunkey can; while regarding his eventual destiny, as long as he did not feel the noose at his neck, he was as happily oblivious to it as the contented pig is amongst the acorns.
"Death comes to all alike, in some form or other," he would say cynically, when he saw the mummy-case sent round, "and we must pay some price for our pleasant lives."
He had entered the presence of Ned and his followers the most woebegone and shivering wretch that ever stood on the gallows.
But the sight of their stalwart forms and resolute faces restored his confidence.
It was like a reprieve to the condemned felon, a week's engagement to the needy and improvident actor.
From abject terror he bounded into the regions of insufferable assurance, like an inflated air-ball.
He insisted on reciting his epic before he took his departure, and dwelt lingeringly over its choice language and far-fetched imagery.
Fortunately it was brief, for he was one of these poets whose muse is gaspy in her leaps, as well as obscure in her metaphor and phrases.
Like a small phial, his mind could not carry or give much at a time, but he fondly believed that what he gave was quintessence.
His thoughts were aged, stale, and feeble, but he dressed them well, and considered, as so many of our moderns do, that the dressing was all that need be considered or admitted.
Our heroes bore the infliction meekly, for they remembered their own lost and adored diary; but Pylea and her companions, and also the Kaffirs, yawned most rudely.
Ned, thinking to please this royal poet, further presented to him a spare compass which he had, also a revolver and a rifle, with some ammunition.
Sotu accepted the compass with effusive thanks, but he shuddered and recoiled before the other gifts.
"Send these to the queen; she will appreciate them, and they may soften her wrath, after you are gone.
Meantime I must go, as I have to superintend my cooks.
There is a new dish which I am introducing tonight from an ancient formula, and I find wonderful amusement in preparing it."
"Indeed," answered Ned, politely.
"What is it?"
"The forgotten art of cooking quails.
We pluck and partly boil them alive in oil before stuffing and roasting them.
The natural juices are thus retained, and the flesh is tenderer than by keeping them until stale."
murmured Ned, trusting in his heart that this refined cook might also have a little slow boiling in oil before he was too stale.
"I have invented some pots, with lids specially contrived to keep the birds' heads outside.
We plunge their bodies in the cold oil, and bring it very gradually to the boiling-point.
We are able to tell in this way when they are sufficiently done, and that is the instant they expire.
It is a pleasant sight to watch their heads during the process."
"Is it, sire?
For the watcher, or for the birds?"
"The watcher, of course," replied the king, smiling, as he caught what he thought was the joke.
"We remove them then, stuff them with garlic, pine-apple, and bananas, and slightly roast them within tamarisk leaves.
I shall send you a dish of them tonight.
They are most delicate in flavour and rarely succulent."
He felt like kicking this callous and cowardly fiend, but policy forced him to dissemble.
"It will be also strictly necessary for you to take with you some royal gifts, so as to give colour to your leaving.
I have control of the queen's treasure-house, and I shall attend to this, and send you some of our artwork in gold, with a few good stones.
I shall also give you, as a parting gift from myself, some dainties of my own preparing to partake of on your journey."
Sotu smiled gently as he said these words, and took his departure.
"Have nothing to do with the king's quails and dainties.
He is an adept at poisoning, and he only smiles like that when he meditates torture and death," said Pylea, earnestly, as soon as the royal wretch had gone.
"He is a genial gentleman," replied Ned, lightly.
"I wonder he hasn't long since poisoned his wife."
"He dare not, for his own sake.
When she dies his daughter will reign, and her first act will be to strangle her father."
"Blessed King Sotu!--happy land!"
said our heroes.
By sundown they were all prepared to leave.
In the dusk several mutes brought the promised gifts from the treasury.
Some time afterwards the dainties arrived in golden vessels.
Our heroes emptied the eatables out on a shrub-covered part of the garden, but the dishes they packed up with the other articles of virtu.
There were a water bag full of large diamonds, and over three hundredweight of cups, vases, and images of gods made from the purest gold.
The hearts of our adventurers beat lightly as they distributed this precious weight amongst their packages.
Six hours after this they paced the ground and watched the illuminated palaces from the walls of their garden, in a fever of unrest and anxiety.
Their hopes were all depending upon the self-restraint of this hopeless drunkard, and Pylea.
Would she succeed?
The full moon shone over the city, so beautiful and stately, with its carved and painted walls, delicious gardens, deep canals, arches, and wide steps; on its monuments, obelisks, sphinxes, and mighty temples; on its crowded, broad avenued streets and gleaming lake beyond, where floated the sloping-prowed barges, with their awnings and gilded saloons.
Would Pylea succeed and secure the ring?
The chariots were standing laden inside the garden walls, ready for the leopards to be harnessed to them.
The young amazons were fondling the fed and tamed beasts in their cages within the stables, or walking beside their sable friends in the side avenues.
They were bidding the handsome Kaffirs, whom they could not keep, farewell.
Womanlike, they would rather see them go than see them owned by more powerful rivals.
But they were grave and melancholy at the coming sacrifice, and did not resent the dark manly arms that were round their armoured waists.
Doubtless they were listening to words that they would not soon forget.
Gradually the streets emptied, and chariots rolled from the palace gates, drawn by the amazons who had been guests of the queen and king.
Only the husbands were left behind with Sotu.
The queen had retired.
Another hour of fearful suspense passed, and then Pylea appeared with the signet-ring.
King Sotu had kept his word for once in his aimless life.
Swiftly and silently the leopards were harnessed to the chariots.
Then each amazon took the reins, and, with her particular friend beside her, drove through the gates and into the almost deserted streets.
It was two hours past midnight now, and the citizens, with the exception of the guards and the male revellers, were long since asleep.
A lovely night for a drive, for young people particularly.
Only the roaring of the confined beasts, with the calling of the frogs in the papyrus reeds, could be heard.
Serene and mellow the moon looked down from a cloudless sky upon the restful city, the empty wharfs and stairs, and the fringe-lined lake, where also slept their god-ships, the crocodiles.
It was a splendid country for women, cats, crocodiles, serpents, and other sacred and venerated things, but not so favourable to men.
Our adventurers were leaving it gladly.
At the outer gate they had a little trouble, as Pylea had expected.
The commandress chanced to be one of the ladies who had decided to compete in the lists on the morrow.
She had fixed her discriminating eyes upon Cocoeni, and when roused up by a subordinate, regarded the exodus with gloomy suspicion.
The order, however, was so definite, and the signet-ring beyond dispute; yet she wanted some particulars.
"It is the written command of Queen Isori, that these strangers pass through without delay.
They go to offer sacrifice to their gods in the desert before the contest," added Pylea, with a dig of her heel at Ned, who crouched behind.
"Yes, dauntless captain," said Ned.
"Your gods are not our gods, nor your customs ours."
"Are these the sacrifices you take with you?"
asked the stately amazon, pointing to the packages.
"Yes," answered Ned, brazenly, "our offerings are all there."
"It is strange, for I was with the queen before supper, and she said nothing of this.
Let me send a messenger to her."
"By no means.
See, it is written here that she is not to be disturbed this night on pain of death.
She is weary with her journey, and wishes to prepare also against the morning."
it is my duty; pass on."
Ned waited with Pylea to see the other chariots go through.
As they did so, the native amazon looked at each one keenly.
she cried, as Cocoeni was passing; "this is the man I have chosen to fight with.
Step forth and let me look at you."
"Get out and satisfy the captain, Cocoeni," said Ned.
"Show your muscles, and be quick about it."
Cocoeni rose, nothing loth, and stalked up to the side of the amazon.
She turned him round, feeling his biceps critically, as an intending purchaser might examine a horse.
Standing side by side, their heads were on a level, a splendid pair as to height and breadth of shoulders.
But the woman had seen more than thirty summers, whereas Cocoeni was her junior by many years.
"You are a fine fellow, yet I think I can throw you," she said, while her black eyes sparkled with admiration.
"Will you try once with me now?"
"Shall I, baas?"
"Yes," answered Ned.
"Get her on the other side of the gate, over by the green bank, while we all pass through.
Then, don't waste any time, grip her quick and pitch her into the lake, if you can.
It will create a diversion."
He gave these instructions, in English; then, turning to the warlike dame, he said mildly in her language--  "The lord Cocoeni will take up your offer, brave lady; but as I have no desire to see either of you hurt on the hard stones, and so spoil our sport when the day comes, I fix upon yonder soft sward as the ground.
One throw only."
"So let it be."
The dame retired for a moment to prepare herself and do up her hair.
She had been standing up to now in her night costume.
While she was absent, Pylea whispered something to one of her band.
The girl nodded, and, turning her chariot, darted back the way they came.
"Where is she going?"
"To keep watch in the shadows," whispered Pylea.
"This woman is my aunt, therefore I know her well.
She will send a messenger to the palace while she delays us, and that messenger must be stopped."
Cannot we make a bolt for it while she is inside?"
"Two hundred bows would be bent if we did so.
One bow will be quite sufficient," answered Pylea, calmly.
She was a plucky girl, quick and prompt in her actions, and had proved a first-rate chum all through to Ned and his friends, but she had no weak sentimentalism about her.
She could remove a human impediment with the some utter indifference that country ladies kill pullets.
As a friend, however, she was sans reproche.
Ned felt that the present occasion was one in which he must not be too fastidious, yet he shuddered to think of the luckless messenger.
As the last of the chariots, except that one which had turned back, passed beneath the lintel of the archway, Ned saw a white-robed, bald-headed little man steal out of a side-window, and glide rapidly across the moonlight to the shadow side of the road.
As he did so, Pylea again touched Ned with her foot.
"My aunt will be a widow sooner than she intended," she whispered.
"There goes my uncle to meet his death."
Almost immediately afterwards the amazonian aunt came out of the guard-house door, clad in light chain armour, and with only a scarf tied tightly round her waist.
She was barefooted, so that she might not slip easy.
She looked a formidable figure as she strode over to where Cocoeni was waiting for her.
A crowd of the guard was gathered round, leaving the gate open and unprotected.
"Wait one instant," said Pylea.
"Ah, here they come."
The young amazon who had been sent back, drove her chariot and her Kaffir passenger almost noiselessly.
She nodded slightly as she drew up, and murmured softly--  "He lies in the shadow, thirty yards distant.
I removed the arrow from his heart as we passed him."
"Good," answered Pylea; then together they passed through the gate and drew up at the other side.
Pylea, having ordered her followers to drive on out of arrow-shot, remained behind with Ned and Cocoeni's driver to watch the contest.
The combatants stood face to face watching each other keenly, and looking out for a chance to spring in.
The newly made widow was a wily old bird, and up to every feint.
She was in no haste to close, as she wished to linger the game.
Several times she pretended to be about to take the leap, always to draw back.
"Quick, Cocoeni; trust to your strength and finish it," cried Ned, who was chaffing at the delay.
"All right, baas."
Cocoeni walked slowly towards the amazon, who now began to retreat, but towards the edge of the water.
Seeing this, she suddenly sprang to one side and attempted to pass him.
It was a fatal move; for Cocoeni, quick as lightning, leapt upon her, and gripped her sideways, slipping both arms under hers as she twisted round.
There was no question of chivalry or gentle treatment now.
The woman felt, as those muscular long arms closed round her, as if she was in the embrace of a python.
It was such a hug as she had never before received.
Her ribs felt cracking, and her lungs compressed so that she could not breathe or use her arms.
She was taken at a disadvantage and completely at his mercy.
Cocoeni had his back towards the lake, which was three yards distant.
With a hoarse, savage laugh, he imprinted a loud kiss on the open mouth so close to him, and the next instant sent her flying over his head three feet clear of the bank.
With a shrill cry and a loud splash, she disappeared into the water.
"There, baas, she will not forget the throw of Cocoeni," he shouted, as he clambered into his chariot.
Away they dashed at full speed--getting a parting glimpse of the drenched dame as she scrambled drippingly ashore; past the suburban villas and fields and out to the arid desert.
"My aunt Culpatra will not be content with one messenger," cried Pylea, as they rushed along.
"We shall be pursued by the queen and her army.
Fortunately, we have an hour's start, and these animals are the best in Karnadama."
"But extra loaded," answered Ned.
"Yes; yet you can shoot with your guns further than they can with their arrows."
"I hope we shall not have to do this."
Twice before daybreak did Pylea and her companions stop their leopards to feed them with those little cakes.
After the animals had eaten these they went on with renewed speed.
"What is that you give them, Pylea?"
"Something to keep them fresh.
A little does them good and removes fatigue.
Too much will kill them, yet they will run with unabated speed until they drop dead.
I fear most of these will be dead when we reach the mountain, for we must not spare them this journey."
Day came and almost passed, without any signs of pursuit.
The only stops they made were those when more of the cakes were given to the animals.
Then they went on again at full speed, seemingly as fresh as ever.
The sun was just dipping below the desert line when Ned saw a long low cloud appear.
He did not need to call the attention of Pylea to ask its meaning.
The pursuers were coming.
All that night the leopards ran at their swiftest, being fed often.
When morning broke the gold mountain was distinctly visible; but so also were their followers.
A long line of moving dust rolled in the rear, spreading miles wide.
Queen Isori had brought half her army with her, and they were driving lightly.
She was resolved to stop the fugitives if she could.
The pursuers are gaining ground, but they are still as far off as the mountain, and it is stationary.
The leopards are fed recklessly, and rush along madly as if they were free.
With long bounds they cover yards of ground at a time.
Their eyes blaze fearfully, and bloody froth flies from their gaping jaws.
They want no driving now; they are possessed with the most savage fury.
"They will reach the mountain.
We dare feed them no longer; they are mad," cried Pylea, looking only at the cliffs.
Ned was looking behind.
How rapidly the pursuers were gaining!
Already he could distinguish individuals where before he had only seen a confused mass.
Their arrows were gleaming in the bright sunbeams.
The chariot jolted suddenly and overturned, sending Ned and his bundle sprawling.
Pylea had leaped lightly out and was helping him up.
The leopards lay gasping their last breath.
All along the line the others lay in the same condition.
Some had fallen exhausted, others the amazons had slain with their arrows, to prevent the maddened beasts from dashing against the rocks.
The drivers and passengers were running full speed for the archway, carrying their loads with them.
From the desert came a hoarse roar like the sound of waves breaking on shingle.
It was the army of Karnadama urging on their lions and leopards.
panted Pylea, no longer calm.
Ned got up and ran, as he had never done before, through the hall, and up the long stairway that led to freedom.
"Run on for your lives, and look not back; we will follow," cried Pylea, as she ranged her warriors in front of the stairs.
Up they went, one after the other, as fast as they could scramble, those thousands of steps.
Exhausted at last, they reached the chamber of the pythons.
Here they sank down breathless to wait on Pylea and her regiment.
Not a sound could be heard from below.
Had the brave girls remained there to face their infuriated queen?
For the second time in their lives our heroes felt themselves to be mean cowards.
The first time had been when they killed the baby gorilla.
"We can never leave these brave girls in the lurch like this, lads.
We must return and save them, or die with them," cried Ned, in sharp tones of agony.
Gripping his revolver, and followed by his men, he rushed with frantic steps down the stairs.
At the fourth landing he stopped suddenly.
There before him leaned against the wall the friend of Cocoeni, with the blood dripping through her fingers as she pressed her hand against her side.
"Come no further," she gasped faintly.
"I only am left alive."
cried Ned, starting back in dismay.
"Are they all slain?
Is Pylea also dead?"
Cocoeni by this time had reached forward, and was holding the dying girl in his arms, the hot tears running down his cheeks.
"All," replied the girl.
"I was sent forward to close the wall at the first stair.
Before I reached it they were cut down.
I saw Pylea fall even as I received this wound, but I had strength enough to close the stone door and creep up the stairs thus far."
Her head sank as she uttered the last words against the breast of Cocoeni.
"Bring her up to the hall, Cocoeni," said Ned, brokenly.
Not a dry eye was amongst them.
Cocoeni carried her up as gently as he could, but before they reached the sculptured hall, she was almost gone.
As he laid her down, she opened her eyes and smiled wanly.
Then she whispered so faintly that they had to bend close to hear the feeble accents.
"They cannot open the door I closed, for hours.
You have time to escape.
Destroy the stairs at the top and you are safe."
Her military trained mind was still planning, even although the life-blood was nearly drained from her heart.
Another long pause, and then she opened her lips and her eyes for the last time.
"Cocoeni, you are only a man, after all, for you are weeping just as ours do when they are hurt.
Kiss me, as you did two nights ago in the garden, for which I rebuked you then, but I am now as weak and foolish as you are."
Cocoeni pressed his warm lips to her cold ones.
When he removed them her lips remained apart.
She was dead.
"It is a wonderful story, boys.
With those stones and bric-a-brac to support it, I am the last man in the world to cast doubts upon its veracity.
I wish, however, that you had brought with you that quarter cohort of young amazons; we could do with them now in Rhodesia.
However, go on and finish your yarn.
What did you do with this poor girl?"
Dr Jim had received our heroes at Bulawayo.
At present they were on their way from the capital of Rhodesia to Mafeking with a train-load of native allies.
Other laden trains were following in their track.
Much had happened during their absence from the field of progress, as their captain informed them.
The Transvaal Government only, like the kingdom of Karnadama, stood still.
The suzerainty dispute had swallowed up many mouths, while Kruger, with his usual policy of aggressive arrogance and false professions, had lain like a great tortoise in the way, pushing its head out, and drawing it back again before it could be chopped off.
He was making a move at last.
Emboldened by the quiet deportment of Britain, he considered that the hour had arrived when he could show his head plainly, and walk on as he wanted.
Crafty and timid although he was, Kruger had not been idle inside his shell.
He had watched the political troubles that threatened his enemy, until now he considered their hands too full with outside affairs to be able to send much help to South Africa.
It was a fixed belief with Kruger and his countrymen that England was in the same position that the Roman Empire had been when her legions were recalled from Albion.
He knew how her power was envied by the other great nations, and how isolated she stood facing the world.
He had intrigued with those ill-wishers until he considered himself sure of support.
Only blind hatred moved him now.
To break the power of this abhorred race, he was prepared to sacrifice the Republic and make his countrymen serfs, so that he might be allowed to have a life-post as governor, and see the Uitlanders crushed.
"You have just come in time to take a hand in clearing the board, if you are not afraid to venture once more into Krugerland," Dr Jim had told them when he met them.
"We have sure intelligence that he intends to abrogate the Convention of London, and declare the absolute independence of the South African Republic on the tenth of this month.
We have a copy of his intended ultimatum.
He will allow the Uitlanders only twenty-four hours to decide whether they will declare themselves as enemies to their native land, or else be driven from the country, or imprisoned, with their property confiscated.
A general massacre is clearly intended of all who dare resist.
"It is now the third of October, so that we have seven days before us to prepare for the old murderer.
We have not been idle any more than Kruger has, and this time we have played his own game, the hiding one.
From Fourteen Streams to the Portuguese border on the north we have the Transvaal environed and practically hemmed in; from Fourteen Streams to Usuta they are also isolated, although they do not know it; the natives of Swazi and Gaza lands are ready to rise at the signal, and pour across the border; a fleet of warships protects Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, and Durban, so that the tactics of Mr Schreiner are so far defeated.
"We have hundreds of volunteers on their way from Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
They are bringing arms and ammunition enough for all purposes.
They will land at Durban and Cape Town in a few weeks at latest.
Yes; I think we are nearly ready this time for the tortoise when he puts out his head, without having to trouble our mother for too much help, except those who man her fleet."
"And what can we do?"
asked our heroes.
"Command us, for we are ready."
"Well, I want you, Romer, to take a message into Johannesburg, and wait there till the fun begins."
"Yes," replied Ned.
"You must have some kind of disguise.
I see you have grown a crop of down on your cheeks.
I think you might sacrifice that, and you'll make as smashing a young woman as one of your amazons."
Ned laughed, and said he was willing to change his sex for the time.
"All right," replied the doctor.
"We'll put the dressmaker of Mafeking on to you and your chums, and send you in to cajole the Boers.
You, Raybold, must go to Pretoria.
And you, Weldon, to Bloemfontein.
I shall want Cocoeni and his fellows along with me.
"There must be no hesitation this time amongst the Uitlanders.
On the midnight of the eleventh they must rise to a man, and hold the different towns until the outside forces join you.
If all goes well, as I cannot see how it can miss, take possession of the trains and telegraph offices, so as to let no message go out or enter the land.
Our part of the game must be finished before the world can hear about its opening, and this rotten Republic will then be a thing of the past.
We intend to hold the kopjes this campaign, and force these skunks into the open; also to avoid bloodshed as much as possible, only the victory must be on our side--and complete."
Dr Jim gave our heroes a great many other details and instructions on the journey down.
He had been training and moving men to different parts for the past seven months in anticipation of this event, as settlers and their servants, as unostentatiously as he could manage it.
While Kruger had been busy coquetting with foreign powers, and buying the latest improvement in weapons, Cecil Rhodes had been quietly stocking and populating the lands adjacent to the Transvaal.
"By the way, Romer, I have some personal news for you, which might have interested you more deeply than it is likely to do now that you have made your own fortune."
asked Ned, curiously.
"Mr Rhodes has been home, and looking into your affairs.
He always finds time to attend to the interests of those he takes in hand, with all his other big concerns."
"And what has he discovered about me?"
"That your father first, and afterwards you, trusted as scoundrelly a thief as was ever transported, to manage your fortune."
"Yes; this Jabez Raymond, the solicitor, has robbed your late father and you systematically for many years, forging papers and creating mortgages wholesale.
Mr Rhodes knew your father and the position he held during his life, so he set ruthlessly to work and unveiled the sanctimonious scoundrel.
He is at present doing a seven years' stretch at Dartmoor for his delinquencies, while your property is being looked after by a respectable agent.
You are at present the possessor of a comfortable fifteen hundred per annum and a fine estate in Devon, free of all incumbrances.
This, however, is a flea-bite to what you will have when these stones are sold."
"Do you think they will realise much?"
"Two or three hundred thousand pounds at the least, I should say."
"But by rights they belong to our employer, Mr Cecil Rhodes."
"He will be content with a share in the mine you have discovered, if it ever gets into the market.
These were presents given to you, therefore they are undoubtedly your own property," said the doctor.
"And our followers."
These Kaffirs were your servants.
Besides, so much money would ruin them.
Divide the stones between you three, for they are undoubtedly your property.
As for the idols and cups, you can lend a few of them for our Salisbury Museum.
Now finish your yarn."
Dr Jim leaned back on the cushion, smoking his pipe, while Ned resumed his story.
As he told the tale, the train ran smoothly over that country which so lately had been an unexplored wilderness.
"We had no time to mourn long over the poor young amazon who had fallen a victim to friendship.
We knew that our pursuers would spare no efforts to reach us as soon as they could do so.
"Therefore, satisfied that she, Rhae, was no more, we opened one of the mummy-cases, and, taking out the original lodger, we placed her inside instead.
We wrapped her up in the outer linen of the mummy, after reading the service over her, and replaced the lid of the sarcophagus.
Properly, I suppose, she should have been embalmed, for, according to her religion, her soul was in jeopardy by her being entombed in this fashion.
But I dare say she'll find her body again at the resurrection day quite as easily as any of her countrywomen will find their more carefully preserved earthly shells.
"This done we started up the stairs, carrying the mummy with us.
We did this so as not to horrify the Karnadamains too much with our sacrilege.
We reached the top all right; then, remembering the dying advice of Rhae about breaking down the steps, I took back with me a good charge of gunpowder and dynamite, and, placing this in a wide crevice about a couple of dozen steps from the top, I ran up a train of gunpowder to the hall above.
"I had hardly finished this operation when we heard them coming.
We could hear their shouts and the clashing of their armour as they filled the chamber below and crowded up the stairs.
At once I fired the train, and bolted as hard as I could spin to the outer door of the hall.
"I had only taken about a dozen leaps when the explosion took place.
Into the vast hall the smoke and dust flew from the smaller room, accompanied by the crushing and tumbling of the blasted slabs.
"As soon as the sounds ceased and the smoke cleared, we ventured back to look at the damage done.
We had demolished not only the stairs, but torn great masses out of the walls of the room as well.
Where the entrance to the stairs had been now lay several tons of broken masonry; the passage was completely blocked up.
"We listened, but heard no sounds from below; then, satisfied that we were at last safe, we left the large painted hall.
"Outside we went on the walls and looked over.
There a vast crowd of chariots were standing, with a number of amazon guards.
They saw us, and several bent their bows, but we could afford to laugh at this display, as the arrows only reached a short distance up the cliffs.
"We at once hurried away, however, for suddenly a thought occurred to me that there might be some other way up, and we had no desire to be captured.
"Another thing made us not linger in that deserted citadel.
We had plenty of ammunition and wealth, etc., but we had very little provisions, and only about one bag full of water.
"Fortunately we were going down the hill, and knew exactly how long we should take before we reached the Rhodes fountain.
But for all that, we were nearly dead from thirst before we reached it.
"Those awful bashikonay ants were in our minds also, all down that hot and parching defile.
If we should meet them here, there was no hope for us.
Luckily we did not, nor did we see any of them again.
"The stream was still running as clearly as ever.
We felt happy when we reached it, even although we had not half a meal each left out of our scanty stock.
"Nor did we taste anything after that until we were a full day's journey from the mountain.
Then we killed a couple of lions, and had to satisfy our appetites on them until we got once more amongst the game.
"Here we were all right.
We stayed three weeks on the plains, hunting and drying meat, and otherwise preparing ourselves for the dismal forest.
We had not lost a man since starting, and for this we all rejoiced; but in the return through the forest we were not quite so fortunate, and I am sorry to have to report the loss of ten, whom we had to bury there.
"One day we ran right into a camp of those active little nomads, who surrounded us and gave us battle.
How many they were we could not tell, as they dodged us amongst the trees and brushwood.
"There must have been thousands, for although we shot about fifty of them and kept the rest at bay, yet we suffered from them night and day afterwards.
Not until we were clear of the forest were we able to shake them off.
"They were dreadful and revengeful pests; nor were we ever sure when we might be pierced with one of their poisoned arrows.
"Three of our boys went down during the first conflict, and after that the rest of the ten died from the effects of the poison, one after the other.
They had been touched in vital parts, or else neglected to look after their wounds at the time.
"I got one arrow in the ankle, but my boot so far protected me, that my wound was better in a week.
Cocoeni was wounded in the arm, and suffered dreadfully for three weeks.
The others who were hit managed to suck the poison out quickly and wash the wounds with disinfectants, so that they managed to escape.
"None of us had fever, however, coming back.
The constant excitement we were kept in by these dwarfish, light-coloured savages, with the quick marches we took, must have saved us from that evil.
"After the forest was over, the rest of our journey was only a matter of time.
You may judge of our astonishment, however, when one day we saw the corrugated iron roof of a railway station where some months before we had passed through a country peopled only by natives.
You cannot, however, realise our delight when amongst those who came to welcome us we beheld you--the hero of South Africa."
"I was as delighted to see you, my lads, and so will Mr Rhodes, when he lands in Cape Town and gets my telegram announcing your safe return.
Let me congratulate you on your remarkable success.
You have more than answered our expectations, and I am proud of your achievements."
"That repays us tenfold for all we have gone through," answered our heroes, with beaming faces and exultant hearts.
At Mafeking our heroes received their final instructions, and were metamorphosed into three large-boned, amazonian young women, more awe-inspiring than beautiful to look upon.
They were costumed in a homely fashion, as they were acting the character of domestic servants.
Under this disguise they passed scrutiny and were not suspected by their fellow-passengers.
Tall women are by no means a novelty nowadays, nor are awkward and masculine women, since bicycles and feminine athletics are the vogue.
Indeed, to find a gentle, soft-voiced, graceful, and retiring lady traveller is now the exception rather than the rule.
Therefore, when our heroes forgot their acting and took big leaps in and out of carriage doors, or crossed their legs and their arms, it did not strike any one as peculiar behaviour.
Women of this generation do all that men were at one time only privileged to do.
They raise their dresses and plant their feet on the cushioned seats opposite them, and do all sorts of things that were at one time supposed to be most indelicate.
Our heroes, being well-bred, gentlemanly young fellows, conducted themselves a great deal more decorously than the majority of nineteenth-century ladies would have behaved.
Indeed, their native politeness made them appear singularly superior servant-girls.
They left their treasures with Dr Jim to bank for them at Mafeking, and went on together as far as Bloemfontein, in the Orange Free State.
They had changed trains at De Aar, and again at Tuur Berg for the Boer line.
At Bloemfontein the first of their partings took place, where Fred went off.
Ned and Clarence felt a bit melancholy when they said good-bye to their faithful and long-tried chum.
They reckoned that some fighting had to be done before they were re-united, if ever they were.
If it could have been managed they would have liked to do the fighting in company, yet as it could not be so, they bore the parting bravely.
As the pair crossed the border at Viljoen's Drift, and saw the train boarded by the hateful Boers, they felt the old rage again possess them, which had so long been almost forgotten.
These arrogant, uncouth bullies, who treated male and female with the same rough brutality, made them clench their teeth and draw their brows together until they looked very forbidding females indeed.
But the officials were wonderfully pleasant towards them, considering their unfriendly demeanour.
They admired muscle and bone like theirs, and said audibly that they would be fine vrows some day, when they got fatter.
They were passed on much more easily than they expected.
Once Ned had to correct an impertinent German, who tried to make himself agreeable in the fashion some cads have with unprotected females.
Ned promptly knocked the ruffian down and kicked him under the seat.
Then he leaned back calmly and gazed out of the window, until he suddenly recollected that he should have called the guard instead.
He did this at once as soon as he remembered his sex, and had the man removed in a very dejected and dilapidated condition.
This German did not recover his presence of mind until he reached Johannesburg.
Then, when he saw Ned on the platform, he ran panic-stricken out of the station, vowing that these Englishwomen were demons, and that it would be a long time before he wasted his attentions on another of this ungrateful nation.
"Good-bye, Clara," said Ned, as he stood with his bonnet-box and bag on the platform.
"Take care of yourself, dear, and don't go falling in love with a Boer."
"Don't be afraid, Edwina darling.
I'll go for the cruel wretches if they try to persecute me, as you did with that nasty German."
"Dort's all right, meme leetle pigeon," shouted a bearded burgher, showing his big face near.
"You just wait till you are asked, then you vil be von fine old woman."
"Don't mind the rude fellow, Clara," cried Ned, warningly.
But Clarence was too quick; with a back-handed slap he sent the Boer staggering backwards a dozen paces.
"Couldn't hold my hand back, Eddy dear.
Englishwomen aren't used to these compliments, you know."
"Be careful," said Ned.
"Remember our positions."
The burgher took his blow, however, without resentment.
Several of his countrymen were laughing at him, therefore he slunk away quietly.
"Good-bye, and trusting we may meet soon."
Ned watched the train start with watering eyes, then he stalked out of the station and straight to the Three Ace Club.
As he passed through the streets he noticed that things appeared much quieter than when he was there before.
The police did not interfere so much with the citizens, nor were the armed Boers so aggressive.
It seemed as if a more tolerant spirit was ruling their behaviour.
Knowing what he did, Ned was not at all deceived by these false signs of amiability.
When the Boer is meditating some extra treachery he is always the most amiable.
It is only part of his crafty and deceitful nature.
He likes to lull his victim into a trusting condition, so that he may have him at a disadvantage.
He likes to play like a cat with his prey, and surprise him suddenly.
Ned knew that Kruger had given orders for this extra tolerance, so that the citizens might be lulled into security, and that his thunderbolt might fall the more startlingly upon their devoted heads.
This was only in keeping with his malicious, torture-loving, and savage nature.
These smiling, hard-faced men who looked so grimly indulgent on the unarmed citizens whom they were deluding, were inwardly thinking gloatingly on the coming massacre.
He saw them clinking glasses in the bars with their unconscious victims, and laughing loudly at their jokes, while their revolvers stuck out behind--the revolvers that they intended using shortly on the jokers.
Knowing what he did, Ned hated those double-faced wretches with more intensity.
They were less tolerable in their sullen and insulting state than in their surly humour.
Once he almost betrayed himself by the start he gave.
He had passed Stephanus Groblaar with his broken nose, standing with some exchange men at the door of a hotel.
Stephanus saw him also, and winked leeringly at him as he passed.
Stephanus was a modern city-bred Boer, therefore of the advanced school, who laughed at religion and morality.
With these added vices he retained all the other evil instincts of his race, so that he was utterly graceless.
Ned passed him swiftly with eyes cast down.
He glanced over his shoulder after he had got a little distance, and gave a sigh of relief, when he saw Stephanus leering on a couple of ladies who were passing.
The supposed servant had only attracted him momentarily.
He had failed to recognise his nose-breaker.
Ned felt savagely glad that this vindictive foe was in the city.
He trusted he would stay in Johannesburg till the night of the tenth, for he wanted to have it out with him.
When he reached the club it was almost empty, but the manager recognised him and took him upstairs to a bedroom.
Here he had a wash, and some lunch brought to him.
Then he lay down and rested for a few hours.
He was wakened by some one shaking him, and when he opened his eyes he saw his old friend, Philip Martin, by the bedside.
Ned started up and shook hands.
"Well, my fine young woman, so you have got back."
Ned laughed, and told his message, which the other listened to with sparkling eyes.
"We have been ready and waiting for this message for months past.
So Kruger is going to make the grand move at last?
He will get a mighty surprise, instead of giving us one, as he intends."
He rubbed his hands gleefully.
"I for one am heart-sick of all this long suspense and inaction.
I shall welcome the hour with the greatest delight.
Only there will be some bloodletting before the affair is settled."
"I don't mind that," answered Ned.
"Before I arrived in Johannesburg I did not know what hatred or revenge meant.
It was Kruger and his Boers who planted these passions in my heart on my first visit.
During my absence the plants did not thrive much.
Now that I have returned, however, the Transvaal air seems to have revived them suddenly."
"Yes," said Philip Martin.
"Hatred, envy, deceit, revenge, greed, and gracelessness are plants that grow well and quickly in the South African Republican garden.
They are fine Dutch bulbs, and take kindly to the Transvaal air.
Since you have given me the news of this crowning scheme of perfidy on the part of the crafty and senseless tyrant Kruger, I also feel as if I don't mind shedding some gore if I can only help to put him in his proper place--the felon's cell.
Lately he has been playing one of his favourite games with us, which to those in the `know' means `spoof' eventually.
He has been acting the part of `Codlin' as the only real friend of the Uitlander--the kindly old humourist of Pretoria, the simple-minded farmer chief."
"Yes; he tried to make traitors and spies of us in that way," remarked Ned.
He has been talking about conciliation and the blessedness of unity amongst brethren.
Every Sunday of late he has occupied the Dopper pulpit, and his orations have been noted for their breadth and mildness.
The police wink at small offenders where before they pounced upon them rigidly.
A general tide of indulgence and generosity appears to be setting in towards us in every direction.
There are rumours that the franchise and full burgher rights will be proclaimed on the tenth.
This the Volksraad have already formally passed, with certain conditions which are to be told us by the president himself on that momentous day."
"Yes," replied Ned, grimly; "the conditions you might have suspected all along, knowing Kruger's tactics of old.
He seems to be an animal of instinct and habit.
Like the dog, he always turns round the regulation number of times.
He never varies in his movements, and never changes."
"You are right, Romer; he does not.
He will humour us up to the last moment, and then give us our option--to become traitor burghers and rebels to our queen, or else be shot down ruthlessly.
There will be no mistake about the shooting if we decline, therefore we must take time by the forelock, and anticipate the kindly intentions of Oom Paul.
What are you going to do meanwhile?"
"I shall stick to my present disguise, and live most of my time in the kitchen," continued Ned.
"I can also do any little messages you may want about the city."
"Yes, that will be best.
I'll tell you how you may also serve us, if you can play your part safely."
"In what way?"
"Get a sweetheart in the barracks if you can, and we may, with your help, be able to surprise them on the eventful night, without having to dynamite them.
It may be a great saving of life on both sides."
"It is a low game you ask me to play, Philip; but, as the Jesuits say, `the end justifies the means.'
I'll try it on."
For the next few days all went quietly in Johannesburg.
Those outsiders who were not in the secret were happy that their trouble had blown over, and that better times were now approaching.
The three-ace club-men went about their business, and pretended to be satisfied, as the ignorant were.
The armed Boers behaved like brothers.
The past sins of Oom Paul appeared to be condoned.
Every one praised him now as the kindly old patriarch of Pretoria, who was at present hard at work growing a pair of angel's wings.
Ned had succeeded in fascinating a big German Zarp, and spent a portion of each day in his company.
Ned took the Teuton in preference to a Dutchman, as he had not any repugnance to this nation, yet it was a sacrifice to be amiable even to him.
On the ninth of the month he had two letters, one from Fred, who called himself Fanny, and the other from Clarence.
They had arranged on terms by which they would be understood by each other, that might be read without suspicion by any one.
Fred wrote--  "Dear Edwina,--  "When I reached my situation I found that my place was already filled up, and that I was not wanted.
I intend, therefore, to come to Johannesburg, and be near you and Clara.
I'd like to see the shops of Pretoria, as I hear they are grand affairs.
Crowds are going from here, so I expect there will be a city full presently.
"Your loving cousin,--  "Fanny."
Between the lines Ned read--  "The Orange Free State will join with the Transvaal in the coming struggle.
The Uitlanders here are all prepared, and have efficient leaders.
Volunteers are coming in to help you in great numbers.
I am also coming to take a hand."
Clarence wrote--  "Dear Edwina,--  "This is such a pretty place, and I am most comfortable in my situation.
I trust you are the same, I have found a sweetheart, after all, amongst the Boers, such a nice, useful, frank fellow.
He took me to the Dopper Kirk on Sunday to hear the president preach.
What a noble old gentleman he is, to be sure!
So full of Christian charity and fatherly sentiment.
I fairly fell in love with him, as you will, I am sure, when you see him.
My sweetheart is his footman, so that I have been introduced to the household, and can find my way about.
I have a plan how to manage something, and have already quite a host of friends here and am doing well.
Are you coming up to see me when Fanny comes?
Do so if you can, and I'll get Johann to show us over the private garden of the dear old president.
A lady friend of mine is writing this for me, as I have hurt my right hand.
"Your loving friend,--  "Clara."
Ned interpreted this note as follows:--  "Game all right.
Have got the old humbug Kruger under my eye, and have a plan how to make him my prisoner when the time comes.
Friends here ready for emergencies.
If you can come up and help, do so."
That same afternoon Fred arrived, and the two took the night train to Pretoria, having forwarded a wire for "Clara" to meet them.
Once more our heroes entered the abode of Kruger, ushered this time by a back entrance under the guidance of the friendly footman Johann.
They spent the night together and studied their plans.
When Clarence revealed his scheme they admitted that it might be done.
If he could capture Kruger, it would be a big feather in his cap.
"Oom Paul is not the man to be taken by force alone," said Clarence.
"He is game enough to put a pistol to his own head rather than yield.
Now that Fred is here, my plan is that one of us shall offer to change clothes with him when he is hemmed in, and take him unawares somehow.
We'll trust to chance for the how, when the time comes."
Then it was all duly arranged, and they prepared themselves for the morrow.
It was a hot day in Pretoria, and the town was crammed with visitors.
Church Square was blocked with people, and every other street was filled almost to suffocation.
At the hour appointed the president and his wife drove up, surrounded by a close line of guards.
He took his place on the platform that had been raised above the crowd outside the Government buildings.
He was greeted by thunders of applause and a salvo from the forts; then, as he rose, breathless silence succeeded the noise.
He began by reading over the resolutions and decrees of the Volksraad with respect to the Uitlanders.
The reforms were granted even more completely than the Uitlanders had hoped.
There were clauses, however, to each of these generous concessions which, to those who knew what the termination would be, crippled and nullified the most important.
But the general audience was not in a critical mood.
It roared itself hoarse with wild applause.
While this shouting was going on, the burly president stood grinning upon the crowd like an amiable gorilla.
Then, when silence was once more restored, his expression suddenly altered.
His cheeks became puffed, and his eyes sunk back beneath his heavy brows, while his big ears stood out.
Then with a thunderous growl, like an angry beast, he read the declaration of independence first, and the defiance to England, and finished his oration in his harshest accent.
"To your tents, and consider whether you will be with us or against us in this holy struggle for independence.
My ultimatum is already on its way to this verdomde government, that would deprive us of our rights.
In twenty hours from this, every subject of England will be our enemy, be imprisoned, and shot if we think fit, or expelled from our country and their property confiscated.
To your tents and consider, for your fate is in your own hands."
These words the grim president thundered out to the dismayed Uitlanders; then he turned abruptly and left the scene as he had come, protected by his armed guard.
For a moment stupefaction held the crowd silent, then a deep growl went up from the masses who were being dispersed by the Zarps.
At this instant Ned Romer felt a touch on his arm, and, looking round, he saw Philip Martin at his side.
"This ultimatum has changed our plans," he whispered, as he drew the three friends out of the crowd.
"The English Government will now decide the question, and we must do nothing inside the Transvaal to disturb their plans.
Our orders are now to clear out before this ultimatum expires, and give Oom Paul no excuse for his next step."
Philip Martin was gloomy, and the faces of our heroes also fell considerably.
"And are we to do nothing, Philip, after all our preparations?"
asked Ned, in a disappointed tone.
"Nothing inside the Transvaal.
Our work will be outside, and there will be lots to do there, you take my word.
We must follow the example of the Jews, and skedaddle if we can, before the lines are closed.
Johannesburg must be left for the present, until we can come back with the British army.
Tomorrow Natal and Cape Colony will be invaded, and then England can no longer hold back.
I am off to join Baden-Powell, at Mafeking.
Dr Jim has gone to Ladysmith, and you three fellows are to proceed to Kimberley, where you will find Mr Cecil Rhodes.
It is a bit disappointing, I will allow; but this is going to be a bigger and a more complete affair than we could have accomplished, therefore we must be content to leave it to the proper hands to clear the board."
Philip Martin shook hands with them, and walked quickly away to warn others of his own party, while our heroes prepared for their exodus.
This most inhuman and bloody-minded Kruger, who misquoted Scripture, as he so often did, considered himself safe to order his victims to their empty tents.
He had stripped them, as he fondly thought, of all means of protecting their wives and children.
As he imagined, they had only their naked fists to support their manhood against his armed hordes; therefore he could be as bold as a bushranger who has bailed up a household.
He had them, or, as he impiously remarked, "The Lord of the Boer hosts has put them into our hands, even as He gave the Amalekites up to the vengeance of Israel."
To those who were not in the "know," the Jew dealers and other aliens, who had no patriotic interest in the land, this ultimatum fell like the first ashes of Vesuvius upon Pompeii.
It was definite, clear, and curtailed.
They had either to join in and fight with the Boers, or else be treated with those who stood for English authority.
There was no equivocation, or holding aloof.
Johannesburg, with its riches, must be abandoned, and at once, i.e.
within the next twenty hours at latest.
Those who remained in that city would be forced to take up arms by the Boers, when the time of grace was over.
They were driven like sheep into the pen, where they were to be slaughtered if they did not declare themselves enemies of England, and "bind" themselves to the masters of this Boer rebellion.
Poor, miserable, and terror-stricken wretches--these gold and diamond traffickers, who had come here only to make money, and who were without a single molecule of courage in their composition,--they were placed between two fires, and knew not where to turn for safety.
They were likely to be shot or hanged whatever side they decided to take.
They drove home in their flash traps, or in the saloon cars, with bloodless, flabby lips and staring eyes.
Inside their swell houses they collapsed, and found the champagne and brandy of no more aid to them than coloured water.
Their wives, however,--the painted, illiterate, dyed-haired, and outrageously dressed and be-diamonded ex-shop girls, ex-barmaids, and ex-variety actresses,--were not going to let the twenty hours pass before making up their minds what to do.
The Boers were at their doors, and at present bosses of the show.
Like Simon, Lord Lovat, they believed in serving the customer who was in possession.
By six o'clock that night thousands of these mercenaries had signed the papers of allegiance to the Republic, and left Johannesburg in detachments, escorted by their masters, while their women were driven out of the country to become paupers at Durban and Cape Town.
After a frightful and never-to-be-forgotten train journey, our disguised heroes at last found themselves on British soil, with hearts burning with rage and hatred at the vile treatment they had received in the trains.
The rush for trains by that panic-thralled crowd of refugees resembled a stampede of wild cattle.
Delicate women and children struggled frantically for places with rough, strong men, and were glad to find themselves packed in open trucks.
Order was at an end, and gallantry rarely displayed by that pushing, shouting, and sweltering crowd, while the Boer officials only mocked at their despair.
By reason of their personal strength, however, and taking advantage of their disguises, our heroes managed to secure good places for themselves; and also to protect a number of ladies, who would otherwise have fared badly.
During the journey, also, the burghers had reason to regret insulting and trying to frighten these three strapping young females.
When they reached Cape Colony they learned much more than they had been aware of before.
Paul Kruger and his burghers were in a better condition for warfare than had been suspected.
The loyal colonists had also been trifled with and hoodwinked by the Honourable Mr Schreiner and his traitor gang.
In fact, the British forces were so scanty and ill-provided, while on the enemy's side were so many spies and rebels, that the young men no longer wondered at the courage of the Transvaal chief.
Already war had been declared, and Cape Colony and Natal invaded in force.
If the rebels had only proper leaders, the English possessions were in extreme danger.
England also seemed bristling with renegades and pro-Boers, whose yelpings disturbed the loyal colonists greatly.
But the lion was rousing up for action, and the nation shouted out for punishment to be meted out to those insolent rebels.
From every part of our mighty Empire came the offer of help to the mother country.
The Boers, by their invasions, had united Englishmen as one people.
When our heroes heard this news, they saw the wisdom of letting the Federals have the first blow.
They were now going to join the man they adored, and take a hand in the great coming struggle.
It was November 3rd before our heroes managed to pass the rebel lines and get into Kimberley.
Here they found the town in a state of siege, but well prepared.
Cecil Rhodes was calm and cheerful, with no doubts as to the results of the war.
He welcomed the adventurers warmly, and heard the account of their travels with pleasure.
The news they brought him also from the outside gave him great satisfaction.
"There is nothing else to be done now but to make ourselves as comfortable as possible here, and defend ourselves until we are relieved.
We shall all have enough work to keep us from being dull."
He was right, as our heroes found as the weeks rolled past.
General Cronje and his army kept them in a constant state of attention and excitement.
Thanks to the personal magnetism of Cecil Rhodes, with his unfailing serenity and constant exertions to amuse the besieged townspeople, the first two months, although nerve-trying, were not unpleasant from a social point of view.
Balls, concerts, and parties filled up the intervals of bombarding and repelling the enemy.
Schreiner, as far as could be done.
Had the loyal colonists trusted implicitly in the Cape Premier, Kimberley, as well as Mafeking, must have succumbed in a month.
This Bond leader had played his cards well to serve his friends the Boers at the expense of his fellow-subjects; but Cecil Rhodes, like Baden-Powell, found himself equal to the occasion.
Inadequately garrisoned as it was and imperfectly armed, the mines which they were protecting proved of invaluable service to them.
From the debris they formed perfect forts and trenches, and soon made the place impregnable.
They had a splendid mayor, a commander of infinite resources, and a garrison of undaunted heroes.
The result was that they kept Cronje with his hosts and Long Toms at bay, and went on eating, drinking, fighting, and enjoying themselves in spite of the deadly dangers that environed them.
Yet it was nerve-trying, and added grey hairs to every head in that beleaguered town, young and old.
Out of bravado they might speak of those bursting shells and those numerous attacks as subjects for joking, but all the same, the sport was grim and heart-corroding.
Every hour had its casualties, with wounded and killed.
No one knew the moment their own hour might come.
As time went on and they became more isolated from the world, it took a lot of pluck to keep a bold front to the relentless, treacherous, and dastardly foe.
If they had not occasionally received news of the outside world by special runners, they must have lost heart long before their provisions became short.
But they did get reliable news now and again, and that kept them up to concert pitch.
The brave fellows knew that the world was watching their heroic efforts, and that the Empire had risen and was pouring out its best sons to help and rescue them.
They heard what Canada, Australia, and New Zealand were doing.
They knew that the home Government was now working with might and main to repair its former errors of undue trust and confidence.
They would not be deserted, nor would England neglect her duty now.
The iniquitous and false Boer would be crushed, even although it cost England her best and bravest.
This braced them up and enabled them to endure all that they were called to endure.
They knew that the enemies of England--those wretched traitors, traducers, and fratricides--were repudiated by their countrymen as obnoxious vermin.
They knew that the gold which Kruger and his hireling Leyds had scattered broadcast, had failed to influence the people.
The people of England were not to be biased by paid demagogues.
They demanded that right should be done, and the Government obeyed the universal voice.
The defenders of Kimberley were holding this post for the Empire, and they did so bravely, now that the Empire appreciated their efforts.
While a man was left, and an ounce of food remained, Cronje might bark his loudest, they would never cave in.
This was the kind of spirit which moved the whole camp.
When food began to fall short and they had to buckle their belts tighter round their waists, they did so with a jest, for they knew that the end must be victory.
They heard the news about Ladysmith, and all about the British disasters.
But they also heard that, instead of sixty thousand men being sent out to help them, England was packing off two hundred thousand of her best soldiers, and ready to send at the back of that six or eight hundred thousand, if wanted, to clear the board.
That assurance braced them up.
The Lion and his cubs were in earnest now, and the inflated rebels were doomed.
The Boer had thrown off the mask too completely ever to be trusted with a rifle again.
He must be disarmed and kept so until he was civilised.
The master villains, Paul Kruger and his weak-minded catspaw, Steyn, would be arraigned for their crimes against civilisation and quashed.
This Cronje, the vile and brutal murderer, would yet be tried for his atrocities, and punished as he deserved.
Schreiner and his brother traitors would have to give account of their stewardship and be properly rewarded, and the land would be free for honest colonists to cultivate.
Not a man in this beleaguered garrison but rested assured that those Irish Nationalists, those paid Boer agents and home-bred renegades, as well as the treacherous Cape Afrikanders, would yet get the just reward of their atrocious treason; and this braced them up to endure half and quarter rations, and to stand to their guns while famine, fever, and shells thinned their ranks day after day.
They trusted in their country to do her duty when the hour of retribution arrived, and to punish those dastards who used explosive bullets, fired on hospitals and the women's quarters; who used the sacred white flag for murder, wantonly slaughtered the wounded and their benefactors in spite of the red cross flag; who ravenously destroyed and looted farms, and did in a hundred ways what savages would have been ashamed of.
They trusted that all these dastardly actions would be sifted and punished, in individuals as well as in masses, therefore they kept up their spirits and held to their posts without a thought of surrender.
Let England remember the lacerations and wounds of her brave and dauntless sons when the hour comes for dealing with this most unworthy and despicable foe.
They have fought well, but so do many of the most atrocious murderers, pirates, and bushrangers, when driven into a corner, yet all the same the pirates are hanged when caught.
A rat, a snake, or a scorpion will also face up under such circumstances, yet these vermin are crushed all the same.
Desperation and brute viciousness is not heroism, any more than tolerated treason is a token of nobility.
Ned Romer and his comrades did their part like brave men during this prolonged siege.
It was a magnificent education to them as sons of the Empire.
Fortunately they escaped so far woundless, and also kept off the sick-list; yet during those four and a half months they had plenty to do, and, like the rest of the defenders, had little time to rest.
And while they were holding their own they heard how gallant Baden-Powell was guarding little Mafeking, and how Sir George White was keeping the enemy at arm's length in Ladysmith.
Never a thought of surrender troubled any soul at either of those places.
All the world was watching them, and they meant to come out right.
It did not trouble them too much that Sir Redvers Buller was stopped on the Tugela, or Lord Methuen at the Modder River.
They knew what men and cavalry these generals had at their command, and how impossible the task was, before proper reinforcements came, so they were content to wait and trust.
Then came the glorious news that Lords Roberts and Kitchener were on their way with all the men and armament required.
"Now for the clearing of the board!"
cried Cecil Rhodes, exultantly.
"We shall soon be on full rations again."
Many thought the news too good to be true, but their fears were groundless.
In a few weeks more the bombardment suddenly ceased.
On a happy day General French rode in, after a message, "French coming to relief of Kimberley," and their woes were over.
Cronje was in full flight, and the first decisive blow had been struck at the rebels.
Then there was rejoicing in Kimberley, and our heroes were at liberty to follow the rest of the war.
After their long confinement in Kimberley, our heroes were rejoiced to get the chance of a gallop over the veldt with the hunters of Cronje and his flying army.
They therefore joined General French, who with his cavalry hastened from Kimberley to cut off one line of retreat.
On Sunday, February 18th, the Boers were brought to bay at Klip Drift, and a most desperate rearguard action was fought and won.
Outflanked and surrounded on all sides, General Cronje took his last stand in the bed of the river, and prepared himself for his fate.
How many men he had on that Sunday will probably never be known, yet ten thousand was the estimated number.
When he at last surrendered, only four thousand men were left to lay down their arms.
It was a terrific massacre, which lasted for ten days, as Cronje, with the desperation of a doomed pirate, sullenly refused to give in even after hope was extinguished, preferring to see his men and women slaughtered like rats in a trap, rather than own that he was conquered.
Doubtless his past atrocities and treacheries made him consider himself a doomed man if taken alive by the people whom he had hated so malignantly and treated so mercilessly.
After the first few days, when he saw division after division come up and occupy the surrounding kopjes in grim and overwhelming numbers, this must have made him abandon hope of any outside aid.
He was trapped, and in a position that was impossible to hold for long.
As the guns poured their deadly fire over his laager, blowing up his ammunition carts and provision waggons, and destroying both men and cattle wholesale, he must have felt that just retribution had at last overtaken his blood-stained soul.
Thinking possibly that, if taken, the only fate he could expect was the rope, he settled down sullenly to die at his post.
With his customary callous indifference to the fate of others, he allowed no thought of his countrymen and their wives to influence him now.
As he had ever been, he remained in this last tragedy the incarnation of ferocious obstinacy.
He was Piet Cronje, the master criminal of the Transvaal.
It was not a pleasant task for the British or their leaders to continue this pitiless, yet necessary slaughter.
During these ten days Cronje was given repeated chances to surrender, but he sullenly refused, even when he knew that the Boers had been driven off on all sides, who had come to break the environment of death.
Trapped on the banks of that river in which they had burrowed like rabbits, he still continued fighting desperately, with the alternatives of death from lyddite, death from starvation, or death from drowning when the river became flooded.
This insensate and wasteful courage, while it filled the world with horror, yet won a certain admiration also.
Had he and his men been only there, he might have been admired as a hero.
But when he sacrificed women and children as well, it was utterly revolting.
The heroes of Ladysmith, Mafeking, and Kimberley took every precaution to protect their women, but Cronje could not where he was placed.
Therefore, as a brave man, he ought to have yielded.
To hold out as he did was the act of a savage monster, not a man.
While his character must for ever make him an object of loathing, as we loathe the memory of those black-hearted ruffians of the Spanish Main, his stubborn courage during those ten hellish days can only merit qualified respect.
It was like the last stand of Dan Morgan, the bloody Australian bushranger, and Morgan was as game as Cronje, with fewer crimes on his conscience.
While the artillery filled the sky with hurtling death, the captive balloon floated above and indicated the targets.
It is not surprising if six thousand Boers perished during those ten days.
The wonder is that four thousand escaped death.
It also speaks significantly for Cronje's discretion, that, when he surrendered, he was unwounded.
Our heroes saw a good deal of action during this time, as they were with those who had the duty to keep back the relieving forces.
But they were trained soldiers now, and the constant movement and fighting made them happy.
Meantime Lords Roberts and Kitchener watched keenly the progress of the siege, and let no chance escape for bringing it to a close with the least possible loss to their soldiers.
Day after day the cordon drew closer round that death-trap, until the Imperialists were almost within speaking distance of the rebels.
At last the Canadians brought their trenches to within four hundred yards of the enemy; then the Boers would fight no longer.
The thought of the next stage, cold steel, cowed them completely.
Thus the sullen Cronje submitted, and placed himself and his followers at the discretion of his chivalrous conquerors.
The shame of England, and the everlasting disgrace of those who placed this stain on our flag, was avenged.
On the anniversary of Majuba Hill, February 27th, its blot was wiped out.
In his gracious reception of Cronje, Lord Roberts proved to posterity how impossible it is for a Briton to cherish revenge for private wrongs.
He had lost his son at Colenso.
His heart must have been bleeding for that loss, yet this gave no tinge of bitterness to his kindly and flattering welcome to his captive.
He granted freely all that Cronje asked, and treated him with the same consideration that an honourable enemy might have expected.
This is one of the greatest acts in a life covered with glory.
Now began the triumphant march to Bloemfontein, with the joyful tidings of the relief of Ladysmith.
In every direction victory favoured our British armies.
The Boers fled panic-stricken before them.
Their day was over, and it was all in vain that the ogre of Pretoria, Oom Paul Kruger, hurried to the front, with his accomplice Steyn.
They could not stop the run.
Oom Paul shed tears, for he was an adept at this kind of thing.
He threatened to throw up his post as president, if they did not show fight.
But as even, to the most ignorant of his burghers, that post was already over, this threat was poured into deaf ears.
The Lord of battles had been appealed to, and He had decided with justice and humanity against murder and oppression.
------------------------------------------------------------------------  Two of our heroes, however, were fated to stop their battle career outside of Bloemfontein.
Ned Romer and his friend Clarence Raybold each received wounds in the same charge as they approached the town, and were carried to the rear.
Fortunately the bullets were neither explosive nor coated with verdigris, so that no amputation was necessary.
But the wounds were serious enough to incapacitate them from further fighting that campaign.
The young men were therefore taken down to Cape Town, leaving Fred Weldon to represent them on the triumphant march to Pretoria.
It was a sorrowful parting between the three heroes, but neither anticipated it would be long before they were together again.
"We can only pray that you may be in at the wind-up of our old enemy, Oom Paul, Fred," they said on parting.
"Also that you may escape any of these Mauser button-holes in your carcase, that we have to carry with us."
"Cheer up, boys," cried Fred.
"I guess you'll both be up again at the front before we reach Pretoria.
I want you to help me to capture Paulus--that is our ambition, you know."
Bloemfontein had been taken two days before they were permitted to leave with the other wounded, and the doctor assured the two invalids that, if they took care, they would be ready for the saddle again in a week or two.
Ned had a puncture through his sword-arm, and Clarence was wounded in the thigh, but the wounds were clean, and already showed signs of mending.
Among the wounded who were brought in before they left were several Boers, who had been abandoned by their countrymen.
In one of these Fred recognised Stephanus Groblaar.
He had died a couple of hours after his admittance to the hospital.
When this news was communicated to Ned, he murmured--  "I am glad he did not owe his death to me.
It is better to miss than to accomplish a private revenge.
`Bobs' has set us all a splendid example in forbearance."
"Yes; that noble action of Lord Roberts represents the feelings of the British army from commander to private.
To think only of one's duty to the Empire, to fight only for right, to subdue all private feelings and sink animosity,--this is the code of honour of all true empire makers."
------------------------------------------------------------------------  Necessarily our story cannot end at present, since our three heroes have been so busy seeking after adventure that they have not yet had time to fall in love, and no story can be quite complete without a wedding.
Therefore, while two of our heroes are recovering from their wounds, and the other is riding under the orders of the gallant General French, we may safely prognosticate the future of the rotten Transvaal Republic with that of its foolish victim, the Orange Free States.
Universal law and order for South Africa, with equal rights for Boer and Briton under the Flag that means equality and freedom for every human being, white-skinned or black.
Blue for truth, red for love, and white for purity,--these are the signs of the Union Jack, and the combination means freedom, equality, and fraternity, while Justice holds it in her grasp.
Where it waves, oppression and slavery cease to exist.
As for the rebels and traitors.
Forgiveness towards the misguided, after they have paid their fines for their sins.
To the traitors, punishment and contempt.
To the hoary sinner, who has led these two nations astray and destroyed them, the same punishment which he meted out to the reformers--imprisonment; until he has disgorged his ill-gotten and secreted wealth.
After that, watchful surveillance, such as ticket-of-leave convicts are placed under, so that during the scanty remnant of his blood-grimed life he may do no further harm to humanity.
He has been the plague-spot of Africa.
Let him be placed where he may propitiate his Maker, if he can.
Years after this the Boers, as they become educated and civilised, will marvel at their stupendous folly, and curse the hated name of Kruger; therefore, like Attila and other historic monsters, his memory is not an enviable one.
No human punishment can meet his case.
He must be left to God.
Our heroes have won riches, therefore it is not impossible that they may also obtain happiness.
This eBook was produced by Ryan Ramseyer.
We have chosen to do this through the medium of biography, in the belief that the lives of a few representative men would present better opportunities for interesting and effective treatment than an historical narrative, which must have been encumbered by a mass of detail not capable of effective disposition within the limited space at our command.
An introductory chapter serves to give a general view of the course of events and to show the relations of the men and movements which are afterward presented in more detail.
With but one exception our "Ten Englishmen" are men in public life, political or military.
Artists, authors, preachers, and scholars were purposely left out of the account, because they are to receive prominence in other parts of the course for which this volume was written.
The exception was made in the case of George Stephenson, because the revolution in transportation, due to his improvement of the locomotive engine, has had such a powerful influence upon the industrial development of the nation.
In bringing these great personages before the reader our intention has been quite as much historical as biographical.
Each name is linked with some conspicuous problem in statesmanship, and the endeavor has been to set forth the work as well as the workman.
It is hoped that the library notes appended to each chapter will be of assistance to the earnest student, in supplementing the meager outlines of this volume with the abundance of personal detail and wealth of dramatic incident which give life and action to history.
The appendix should not be overlooked.
Its selections from authentic speeches, letters, dispatches, and other writings bring the reader into touch with the men who made England great.
One word more.
They are the men whose lives lay in line with the writer's plan.
If they serve to accentuate the leading features of the history we are not disposed to argue with those who would present other candidates for the honor of inclusion in the list.
since 1783, had twice banded the European states against the French republican armies; but while the English fleets remained masters of the seas, the enthusiasm of the French soldiers, and the genius of their young generals, had thus far proved too strong for the mercenary battalions of despotism.
In the closing month of the year 1800, Pitt's "Second Coalition" had been shattered by the defeat of the Allies at Hohenlinden.
The Peace of Amiens which shortly ensued (March, 1802, to May, 1803) was but a delusion.
England greeted it with joy and hope, but soon discovered its unreality.
From the renewal of hostilities, in May, 1803, until the final triumph of the allies, in 1815, the war resolved itself into a struggle between Napoleon and England.
This young Corsican lieutenant had raised himself by sheer force of genius and unscrupulous ambition to absolute power.
His scheme for the subjugation of Europe beat down every obstacle except the steady and unbending opposition of England.
Pitt, who had withdrawn from the government because of the stupid King's refusal to honor his Minister's pledges of equal rights to the Irish Catholics, was recalled by the universal voice ot the nation to organize the resistance.
Napoleon had assembled immense armaments upon the Channel coast of France for a descent on England, and had created a vast flotilla to transport the force to Kent.
Great Britain trembled with excited apprehension.
Three hundred thousand volunteers offered their services to the government.
But, as often in the past, Britain's best defense was her wooden walls, and the sagacity, seamanship, and valor of her sailors, who out- manoeuvered the combined fleets of France and Spain, crushed their power at Trafalgar (October, 1805), and secured the Channel against the invader.
Pitt's gold had called into existence a third coalition (England, Russia.
Austria, and Sweden), only to see Napoleon hurl it to the ground on the field of Austerlitz (December, 1805).
England's isolation seemed as complete as the Emperor's victory.
Russia, Austria, and Prussia made humiliating peace with the victor, who carved his conquests into new states and kingdoms.
Pitt, who, at the news of Austerlitz, had pointed to the map of Europe with the words "Roll up that map, there will be no use for it these ten years," survived the calamity scarcely a month.
Unable to meet, as yet, the English troops in battle on the land as he had met and defeated those of the Continent, and unequal to England on the seas, Napoleon devised a more insidious plan of campaign.
Believing that a "nation of shop-keepers" might be attacked through its trade, he issued from the Prussian capital, in 1806, the famous Berlin Decree, which was the first note of that "Continental System," which was intended to close the ports of Europe to British goods.
The British government met this boycott by its "Orders in Council," which placed a blockade upon French ports, and authorized the capture of neutral vessels endeavoring to trade with them.
This inconclusive commercial warfare lasted several years, but was far from being successful in its object of ruining England.
Indeed, it is said that the most stringent enforcement of the "Decrees" and "Orders" did not prevent the Napoleonic armies from wearing uniforms of English cloth and carrying English steel in their scabbards.
England first began to make head against the French conqueror when that far-sighted minister George Canning sent Sir Arthur Wellesley to Portugal to take command of the British forces in the Peninsula.
Wellesley had recently returned from India, where he had achieved a brilliant reputation for thoroughness of organization, precision of manoeuver, and unvarying success, qualities which at that time were lamentably rare among British generals.
In Portugal first, and later in Spain, the sterling qualities of the new commander steadily gained ground for England, driving out the French marshals, and carrying this Peninsular War to a triumphant conclusion by the invasion of France (1814).
Created Duke of Wellington for his successes in the Peninsula, Wellesley held command of the allied forces on the Belgian frontier when, on the 18th of June, 1815, they met and routed the French at Waterloo.
That day made Napoleon an exile, and "the Iron Duke" the idol of the English lands in which he continued to be the most conspicuous personage for nearly half a century.
The Congress of Vienna, in which the victors endeavored to restore the damage wrought by the Corsican intruder, added Cape of Good Hope, Ceylon, Malta, and a few less important islands, to the growing colonial empire of Great Britain.
The Holy Alliance, which had been suggested by the Czar in 1815, at the friendly meeting of the Russian, Austrian, and Prussian sovereigns at Paris, was in theory a compact between these powerful rulers--"an intimate union on the basis of morality and religion"--but it soon degenerated into an unholy league for the mutual protection of these three despotic dynasties against the dormant forces of constitutional liberty, which began to stir again in every European state as soon as the Napoleonic specter had been laid.
The French Revolution had given currency to opinions which no congress of sovereigns could wholly repress, and now the policy of the "Alliance," to strangle all constitutional aspirations and rivet the chains of Bourbonism upon limbs that had once known the bliss of freedom, led to fierce intellectual revolt, and sometimes to physical violence.
England had made common cause with Turk and Christian, Kaiser and King, against Napoleon, and for a time her statesmen viewed with complacency the Holy Alliance, so reassuring in its name and so pure in its professions; but when it became evident that this mighty league was to be thrown against every liberty-loving people in the Old World and the New, George Canning broke the irksome bond, and put the land of parliaments and constitutional liberty in its rightful place as the friend of freedom and the foe to the oppressor.
It was the spirit if not the voice of Canning which was powerful to save Portugal from the Bourbon, to recognize the independence of the revolted American colonies of Spain, and to restrain the enemies of freedom from handing insurgent Greece back to the Turk.
His predecessors had been accustomed to sink the interests and desires of England in regard for what the continental power called "the good of Europe."
He was the first statesman of his generation who dared to take an independent position on "European" questions--"to write 'England,'" as he phrased it, "where it had been the custom to write 'Europe.'"
The policy which he inaugurated marks a turning- point in the history of British foreign affairs.
His Ministers, Liverpool, Canning, Goderich, and Wellington, were confronted by serious problems of domestic policy which had sprung up during the long period of foreign wars and partly in direct consequence of those disturbing conditions.
The one recurrent question which found definite settlement in this reign was that of Catholic emancipation.
The penal laws against Roman Catholics had disgraced the English statute-books for two centuries.
On the first of January, 1801, the Legislative Union of Great Britain and Ireland had gone into effect under the name of the United Kingdom.
The Irish Parliament, which had met in Dublin since 1782, went out of existence, and in the place of "Home Rule" Ireland was represented in both houses of the Imperial Parliament at Westminster.
refused to sanction his project of Catholic emancipation.
In 1807 the Whig ministry espoused the same cause, and in turn resigned because of the opposition of the Crown.
In Daniel O'Connell the cause at length found a spokesman whose eloquence, wit, and talent for "agitation" soon combined his Irish partisans into "The Catholic Association."
Working in conjunction with the Whigs of England, O'Connell's followers formed a body which could not be neglected.
Soon after Canning's untimely death the Duke of Wellington had taken office.
He was a Tory, with all the prejudices of that political faith deepened by his birth and training as an Irish Protestant, but the agitation had reached such proportions that he saw in it a menace of civil war, to avoid which he was willing to abandon his most cherished opinions on the Catholic question.
Accordingly, in 1829, the Iron Duke faced about and brought in the bill which, becoming a law by Whig and Canningite votes, admitted Roman Catholics to Parliament, and to civil rights only a little short of complete.
But instead of removing the Irish question from politics, it was only prepared for more strenuous presentation in a new guise, for O'Connell was returned to Parliament at the head of some fifty Catholic members to agitate for Irish independence.
The name of the Stephensons, father and son, is inseparably connected with this work which has affected so deeply the economic and social life of the nation, and has contributed in a thousand indirect ways to the expansion and consolidation of the empire.
It has been said that in 1825 the traveler from London to Rome went no faster than the courier of the Caesars, eighteen hundred years before.
Thanks to George Stephenson's inventive genius, the traveler of today consumes scarcely more time between London and Peking.
In 1830 representation in the House of Commons still remained upon a basis which had been established centuries before.
Meantime the distribution of the voting population had been totally transformed.
The most populous shires had no more seats than the least of all.
There were decayed boroughs which had dwindled in population until but a handful of voters remained, yet these "rotten" boroughs retained their right to choose one or more members of Parliament, while the great modern manufacturing towns and seaports were totally unrepresented.
The agitation for parliamentary reform, which rose in the middle of the eighteenth century, was directed against the sale of seats in the rotten boroughs, and the shameless bribery.
As early as 1770 Lord Chatham had predicted reform or revolution.
His son, the younger Pitt, had proposed remedies, but the deluge which overwhelmed the government of France in the closing years of the century stiffened English conservatism for a century against any radical political change.
Meanwhile the rapid industrial expansion of the kingdom, with its unprecedented increase of population, and the sudden growth of insignificant hamlets into teeming factory towns, had emphasized the injustice of existing arrangements.
Earl Grey, who had been an advocate of reform for forty years, and Lord John Russell, who had championed the cause for a decade, were united in the Whig ministry which succeeded Wellington in 1830.
Supported by a tremendous popular demand which seemed to stir the nation to its depths they brought in their first bill in 1831.
It prevailed in the Commons by a bare majority, but the Tory House of Lords threw it out.
This action by the privileged class was a signal for an indignant outburst from the nation.
The "Radicals," as the advanced Whigs were already beginning to be called, did not conceal their lack of respect for the Upper House, and used revolutionary threats against it as a relic of mediaevalism which should no longer be tolerated in a free state.
But the time had passed when the peers could flout an aroused nation.
When the Third Reform Bill was ready for passage, the ministers secured the King's promise to frustrate the opposition of the Lords by filling up the House with new peers created expressly to vote for reform.
The threat sufficed.
Wellington and the most stern and unbending Tories absented themselves from the decisive division, and allowed the Reform Bill to become a law in June, 1832.
The seats gained by the disfranchisement of the small and corrupt boroughs were distributed to new constituencies in London, Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Newcastle, and the other modern cities.
The more populous counties were subdivided into districts, and the divisions received additional representation.
The franchise had also been extended and based upon a moderate property qualification.
The result was, that the center of political power passed from the nobility and landed gentry, with whom it had resided for centuries, and came to the farmers and shop-keepers, the so-called middle class, lying between the ancient aristocracy of birth and landed possessions and the still unenfranchised masses of mill operatives and agricultural laborers.
That the new Parliament would show a new temper and be dominated by new ideas was but natural.
But those who inferred from the bitterness of the struggle for reform that the nation was on the verge of an abyss into which the Lords and the Crown should shortly topple, greatly deceived themselves.
In these Parliaments and ministries for the next forty years the Whig party usually had the upper hand.
In 1834 Parliament revolutionized the system of public relief to the needy which had existed for fifty years, to the extreme demoralization of the poorer working-classes and the frustration of really benevolent purpose.
The old law had assumed that each parish owed every native a living.
A sliding scale was accordingly provided by which, as the rate of wages declined, the parish should pay to the workman enough to bring his receipts up to the standard amount.
Employers took advantage of this system cut wages to a minimum, the parish making up the difference.
Another mischievous clause increased the pauper's dole in proportion to the number of his children, with the direct result of early and improvident marriages.
To put it bluntly, children were bred for the bounty.
The number of persons receiving parish aid was enormously increased.
The self-respect of the poor was destroyed, and the poor-rate became a burden of millions of pounds annually upon the treasury.
The act of 1834 put an end to these abuses by restricting outdoor relief to the aged and destitute, and requiring all other paupers to go to the union workhouse.
Within two years the poor-rate was diminished fully one-third.
The earnest labors of the Abolitionists, Clarkson, Wilberforce, Macaulay, and others, had secured the abolition of the slave trade thirty years before (1807), but the united opposition of the colonial planters to a reform which would deprive them of the services of their chattel laborers postponed the consummation of the humanitarian measure.
The reformed Parliament proved less sensitive to the planters' arguments.
It destroyed the system forever, making a cash compensation to the owners.
A third question, on which Earl Grey's ministry took high moral ground, was a redress of another of the ancient wrongs of Ireland.
The Church of England was by law established in that most distressful country, and the people, though mostly Roman Catholics, were under the necessity of paying tithes for the support of a church which they detested, and which indeed, in a large part of the island, had no existence except for purposes of taxation.
The Irish protest, as has often been the case, took the form of violence and outrage, the so-called "Tithe War," which postponed rather than hastened the redress of their grievance.
But in 1835 the ministry of Lord Melbourne relieved the peasants of this part of their many burdens.
Victoria, as she was known thenceforward, lived to see the dawn of the twentieth century, to witness the enormous development of the British empire in population, wealth, and power, and it is perhaps not too much to say, to win all hearts among her subjects by the simplicity, purity, and strength of her character.
By grace of character she was a model constitutional sovereign, and her benign reign, the longest in English annals, contributed more than the policy of any of her ministers to make the monarchy popular and permanent.
The first decade of the Victorian era witnessed three great agitations, two of which ended in fiasco and the third in a triumph which wrought tremendous changes in the kingdom.
"Chartism," "Repeal," and "Free Trade" were the three topics on which the thought of multitudes was engaged.
The six points of Chartism were: (l) annual Parliaments, (2) salaries for members, (3) universal suffrage, (4) vole by ballot, (5) abolition of property qualification for membership in the House of Commons, and (6) equal electoral districts.
The demand came from the workingmen, who were dissatisfied because the Reform Bill of 1832 had stopped short of their political stratum.
The Chartists copied the method of agitation which O'Connell had employed in extorting Catholic emancipation.
Monster meetings, mile-long petitions, copious effusions of printer's ink and oratory, and a National Charter Association were a part of the machinery.
In 1848, when the prevalent hard times increased the restless discontent of the masses, the movement culminated in a vast assembly on Kennington Common.
A respectful half-million were to march to Westminster and lay their demands, the six points backed by six million signatures, before the Commons.
The year 1848 was one of widespread discontent, the revolution year of the century, and the authorities took pains to guard the peace of London with especial care, even Wellington being called into service to direct the military.
But nine-tenths of the mob failed to put in appearance, and the monster petition turned out to be a monstrous and clumsy fraud.
Nothing came of it at the moment.
The return of better times took the heart out of the agitation, and the progress of orderly political development gradually incorporated three of the Chartist points in the law of the land without seriously affecting the constitution.
In this agitation, again O'Connell's was the chief personage, and his eloquence the chief factor.
It was in effect another phase of the Irish demand for Home Rule.
Since the first day of the new century Ireland had been, for legislative purposes, a part of the United Kingdom.
It was the act which had established this "Legislative Union" and abolished the Irish Parliament which O'Connell was determined to repeal.
All that monster meetings, soul-moving oratory, secret associations, printer's ink, could do to influence the government by parliamentary manoeuver, demonstration of popular feeling, intimidation, and threats of insurrection was done.
As a member of Parliament, and the dictator to his "tail" of half a hundred Irish members, the silver-tongued "Irish tribune" exerted a considerable political power so long as parties were somewhat evenly divided so as to make his support desirable.
But when, in 1841, the Tories came back into office under Sir Robert Peel, backed by a strong majority, this influence declined.
The arrest of O'Connell, in 1843, for treasonable utterances, discredited him with his following, which soon fell apart-the more determined section to carry Ireland's cause to the extreme of violent outbreak, the milder partisans to await a more opportune moment to press their agitation for Home Rule.
