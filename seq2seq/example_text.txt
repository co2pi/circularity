He knew that, as one of the founders of the Canada First party, as Chairman of the Organising Committee of the Imperial Federation League in Canada, then President of it, and after its reorganisation, under the name of the British Empire League in Canada, still President, I had much private information, in connection with the struggle for Imperial Unity, that would be of interest to the public.
He was therefore continually urging me to put down my recollections in order that they should be preserved.
I put the matter off until the year 1899, when I was retired from the command of my regiment on reaching the age limit.
I then wrote my military recollections under the title _Soldiering in Canada_.
This was so well received by the Press and by the public that, being still urged to prepare my political reminiscences, I began some years ago to write them, and soon had them finished.
In the early part of 1908 Dr. Bain read the manuscript, and then asked me not to delay, as I had intended, but to publish at once.
Shortly before his death last spring, he again expressed this wish.
I have consulted several of my friends, and in view of their advice now publish this book.
I have not attempted to write a history of the Imperial Unity movement, but only my personal recollections of the work which I have been doing in connection with it for so many years.
I still feel, as I did when I was writing my military recollections, that I should follow the view laid down by the critic who said that reminiscences should be written just in the style in which a man would relate them to an old friend while smoking a pipe in front of a fire.
