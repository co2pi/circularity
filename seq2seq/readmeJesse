It is necessary to do 

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-10.0/lib64
export CUDADIR=/usr/local/cuda-10.0

Because it doesn't work when the script does this.

This came from 
https://google.github.io/seq2seq/getting_started/

this doesnt work on install,
however after fixing some errors via

https://medium.com/@aloofness54/fix-google-seq2seq-installation-errors-4a1155b13f73


then it works

training demos were installed
via a script that makes 'toy' data, a toy language

the script generates the language and makes directories that are 
well organized and can be a template for a working structure

they are initially stored in 
#~/nmt_data/
